Introduction
============

This is a project for MSDS603 at the University of San Francisco.
Our project is a web application that combines a news-feed with critical analysis tools.
The goal of this project is to provide news readers with contextual information regarding the news they consume.
In this light, the critical analysis tools we provide are a controversy score of the topic of the article, as well as a impact score of the writer.
