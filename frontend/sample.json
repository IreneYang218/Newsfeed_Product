The stunning reversal 18 days after a grand jury indicted the \"Empire\" actor on felony disorderly conduct outraged the Chicago mayor and police department.\nThe decision to drop the charges does not mean the actor was innocent or any new evidence was presented, Magats told CNN affiliate WLS.\n\"We believe he did what he was charged with doing,\" he said. \"This was not an exoneration. To say he was exonerated by us or anyone else is not true.\"\nHe said charges are dropped in thousands of cases, but Smollett's case is getting scrutinized because he is a celebrity.\n\"There are plenty of other cases ... over 5,700 that have gotten some type of alternative or deferred type of prosecution involving a dismissal at the end of the case,\" he said. \"To think that there is some type of infirmity or something that we learned about the case or something that we don't want aired is not true.\" Jussie Smollett leaves a Chicago courthouse Tuesday after the charges were dropped against him. Brothers were 'fully prepared' to testify\nThe story of what happened to Smollett on that chilly night on January 29 has transfixed much of the nation for nearly two months.\nSmollett told police that two men targeted him about 2 a.m., tied a rope around his neck and poured a chemical substance on him.\nAs they attacked the gay actor, they used homophobic and racial slurs, he said at the time. Police spent days scouring through surveillance footage and eventually narrowed their search for suspects to two brothers who knew Smollett. After questioning the men, police later said the actor had paid them to stage the attack as a way to gain publicity. The many twists and turns in the Jussie Smollett investigation\nIn the weeks since the alleged attack, the actor was arrested and charged with lying to police about a hate crime, turning him from a victim to a suspect and then a defendant within weeks. All that culminated in the surprise hearing Tuesday that shut the door on a case that intrigued the nation with its changing story lines.\nGloria Schmidt, the attorney for the brothers, Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, said they were \"fully prepared\" to testify in Smollett's case. After the charges were dropped, the attorney said via a publicist she no longer represents the brothers as trial witnesses in the criminal matter.\nWhen announcing the charges last month, police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Smollett paid the brothers $3,500 to attack him.\nDays before the assault, Smollett allegedly tried to gain attention by sending a false letter to the set of his show. It contained racial, homophobic and political language, along with white powder and a drawing of a stick figure hanging from a tree, police said. Patricia Brown Holmes, the attorney for Smollett, fields reporters' questions Tuesday in Chicago. Chicago divided over decision to drop charges\nThe case has sparked political discord in one of America's largest cities.\nWhile the actor's attorneys hailed the dropping of the case as vindication, the city's top officials issued stern statements slamming what they described as a hoax.\nMayor Rahm Emanuel said the actor falsely reported a hate crime to advance his acting career. As Jussie Smollett proclaims innocence, mayor and police chief take aim at 'whitewash of justice'\n\"A grand jury saw the evidence (and) realized this was a hoax -- a hoax on the city, a hoax on hate crimes, a hoax on people of good values who actually were empathetic at first,\" he said. \"And he used that empathy for only one reason ... himself.\"\nEmanuel described it as a \"whitewash of justice\" that sends a message that people with power and influence are held to a different standard.\nChicago's police union has called for a federal investigation into Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx over her involvement in the case and text messages she exchanged with Smollett family friends before she recused herself in mid-February.\nSmollett's attorney, Patricia Brown Holmes, said no one did them any favors and no political calls were made on their behalf. \"There was no political influence in this case,\" she said.\nShe said city officials are upset because they did not know the state's attorney was going to drop the case. She said it was not the responsibility of the defense team to let them know.\nShe also accused the police of leaking incomplete and inaccurate information to the media. \"The public took that information and treated it as if it were true,\" she said.\nBut when Magats dropped the charges, he said the Chicago Police Department \"did a phenomenal job\" in the investigation.\n\"We stand behind the work that they did. But in the end, this was the justice position in the case,\" he said. \"A grand jury saw the evidence (and) realized this was a hoax,\" Mayor Rahm Emanuel said. 16 hours of community service and $10,000 bond forfeiture\nFor the charges to be dropped, Smollett had to forfeit his bond of $10,000 and do community service, Magats said.\nHe agreed to forfeit the bond and performed 16 hours of volunteer service Saturday and Monday for the Rainbow Push Coalition, which the Rev. Jesse Jackson founded. Stunning reversal in Jussie Smollett case leaves many unanswered questions\n\"It may not have been the disposition that everybody thought would occur,\" Magats told the affiliate . \"He did do community service. He did forfeit $10,000. It's a fair and just disposition in the case.\"\nHis attorneys maintain the actor was attacked in Chicago in January and that misinformation led to a rush to judgment against him.\nAfter the charges were formally dropped, Smollett told reporters he was thankful to everyone who stood by him. He maintained his innocence, saying he would not put his family \"through a fire like this\" for a lie.\n\"I have been truthful and consistent on every single level since day one,\" he said before leaving the court building. \"I would not be my mother's son if I was capable of one drop of what I've been accused of.\"\nSmollett said he wanted to move on with his life and continue to fight for justice, equality and marginalized people.

I didn't sleep too well ever since. I thought it was so sad. You can feel the suffering of other people,\" Sato said . So he decided to get to the rally Sunday any way he could from his home in the Auckland suburb of Howick. Once there, he was supported on the arms of a police officer and another man.

It has brought people together, no matter what their race or anything. People suddenly realized we're all one. We care for each other,\" he continued. After checking in at a vigil at a mosque in Pakuranga, not far from where he lives, Sato decided to hop on more buses to get to the city center and join the big rally. Pakuranga is about 15 minutes away from Howick by bus. From there to Aotea Square, where the rally took place, it takes about 45-50 minutes by bus, depending on the route. There he was helped by police and strangers to the awe of the people marching. I walked beside John going up Wellesley St as the policeman came to help him out. He was so determined and in such good spirits, but the compassion of the policeman's approach was excellent.

The EU rules don't mandate specific technology for the systems, which can be temporarily overridden by the driver. Some carmakers have already developed ways of using GPS or cameras to detect posted speed limits and make sure vehicles adhere to them. European Commissioner El\u017cbieta Bie\u0144kowska said in a statement that 25,000 people are killed each year on European roads, with the vast majority of accidents being caused by human error. Volvo limits its cars' top speed to 112 miles per hour for safety \"With the new advanced safety features that will become mandatory, we can have the same kind of impact as when the safety belts were first introduced,\" she said. Read More The rules, which also mandate crash data recorders and reversing cameras, were hailed by safety advocates. But others raised concerns over the risk of drivers becoming complacent and less focused on the road conditions. The European Automotive Manufacturers Association also has concerns about the technology. It warned last year of \"many infrastructure-related issues holding back its widespread application.\" It said that road signs are not standardized across Europe, making speed limits difficult to detect. Digital maps lack speed limit information for many roads, and the data is not always current. \"That is why intelligent speed assistance systems should be introduced gradually in cars to provide enough time to update our infrastructure,\" it said in December. Intelligent speed assistance systems don't automatically apply the brakes when a car is going too fast. Instead, they limit engine power to keep vehicles to the speed limit unless overridden by the driver. Volkswagen is betting its future on electric cars Some European automakers see an advantage in limiting speeds. Volvo, which is owned by China's Geely, said earlier this month that it would its stop cars from going faster than 180 kilometers per hour (112 miles per hour). It said it is also considering other technology that could put stricter speed limits on cars driving near schools and hospitals. \"We want to start a conversation about whether car makers have the right or maybe even an obligation to install technology in cars that changes their driver's behavior,\" Volvo CEO H\u00e5kan Samuelsson said at the time.

Click to subscribe!\nSpeaking about Anita Hill, a former co-worker of Thomas' who alleged that he had harassed her, Biden said this : \"We knew a lot less about the extent of harassment back then, over 30 years ago. She paid a terrible price, she was abused for the hearing. She was taken advantage of. Her reputation was attacked. I wish I could have done something. To this day I regret I couldn't come up with a way to get her the kind of hearing she deserved, given the courage she showed by reaching out to us.\" Biden's comments were part of a broader condemnation of what he called a \"white man's culture\" that has dominated in society -- and the Senate -- and that Biden believes has \"got to change.\" (He added that he did ultimately vote against Thomas' confirmation.) Which is a good sentiment! And the right sentiment for a candidate who very soon will be running for the Democratic presidential nomination. The problem for Biden -- and the Hill testimony makes it plainly -- is that he came of age in a very different political time, when \"white man's culture\" was totally and completely dominant. And, even more problematically for Biden, he has decades upon decades of recorded Senate votes that, if properly utilized by one of his Democratic opponents (or several of them) could cast him as someone who simply is not made for these times. Read More One of the most remarkable facts about Biden's life is that while he has run for president twice, in neither race has his long voting record in the Senate been given the sort of deep dive that we now come to expect of someone running for president. Biden's 1988 bid was cut short by plagiarism allegations that drove him out of the contest in 1987. In his 2008 run for president, he was never a top-tier (or, really, even second-tier) candidate, and so his opponents largely ignored him and the media didn't spend a ton of time looking into his l ng voting record. (Biden was first elected to the Senate in 1972.) That's not to say that Biden's Senate record doesn't have moments that distinguished him then -- and will distinguish him in the race to come. Biden's boast that he has \"the most progressive record\" of anyone in the 2020 field, which he is not yet in, might be a bit of a stretch, but there's no doubt that he played central roles in passing the Brady guns bill and the Violence Against Women Act . But the broader issue is that Biden has been around politics so long -- and voting in the Senate for so long -- that lots and lots of those votes can and will be picked apart as evidence that he is simply not the right person to lead an increasingly diverse, younger and more female Democratic Party. His stewardship over the Thomas hearing and his vote in favor of the 1994 crime bill are the two most obvious examples of that problem, but there are and will be others. In some ways, Biden is simply a product of his times. As he acknowledged on Tuesday in regard to Anita Hill, \"we knew a lot less about the extent of harassment back then, over 30 years ago.\" True! But this presidential race is being run in 2020, not 1990. And none of Biden's soon-to-be-opponents will let him off the hook for things he said and votes he made decades ago that might have reflected those times but seem deeply out of touch today. The danger for Biden in this race is clear: He runs the risk of coming off like Don Draper in a Peggy Olson world. And, unfortunately for him, there's just not much he can do about it.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.politico.com/blogs/politico44/2012/09/biden-laments-inaction-on-violence-against-women-act-135445", "https://www.youtube.com/user/CNN?sub_confirmation=1", "https://stories.clintonfoundation.org/when-the-gun-lobby-lost-and-america-won-25-years-later-the-brady-bill-is-a-case-study-in-courage-bb92a4c54815?gi=b0b8e412c746", "https://bulletin.cnn.io"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joe biden", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "anita hill", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "thomas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris cillizza", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "biden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clarence thomas", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate judiciary committee", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "delaware", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-03-27T14:59:17.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b93cb5317f734f5c60a87388dd2b910c6697c5b5", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/27/politics/george-conway-op-ed-trump-mueller-investigation/index.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rss%2Fcnn_topstories+%28RSS%3A+CNN+-+Top+Stories%29", "site_full": "edition.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel - HP Hero", "title": "George Conway says Trump 'guilty' of being unfit for office - CNNPolitics", "title_full": "George Conway says Trump 'guilty' of being unfit for office - CNNPolitics", "published": "2019-03-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190308172423-george-conway-georgetown-law-03082019-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 17321, "comments": 4382, "shares": 2799}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cc65c76e67f06880cedbe49c07328b0df4f2a65b", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/27/politics/george-conway-op-ed-trump-mueller-investigation/index.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Veronica Stracqualursi", "published": "2019-03-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "George Conway says Trump 'guilty' of being unfit for office - CNNPolitics", "text": "Washington (CNN) George Conway, a conservative lawyer and the husband of White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, argued in a new op-ed that President Donald Trump is unfit for office, regardless of the Mueller report's findings.\n\"If the charge were unfitness for office, the verdict would already be in: guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,\" Conway wrote in a Washington Post op-ed published Tuesday. Special counsel Robert Mueller did not find that Trump's campaign or associates conspired with Russia, according to Attorney General William Barr's summary of the report submitted to Congress on Sunday. Mueller's investigation of whether the President committed obstruction of justice did not conclude the President committed a crime, but it also \"does not exonerate him,\" Barr wrote, quoting from Mueller's report. Mueller did not make the decision himself on whether to prosecute the President on obstruction. Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein made the determination the evidence was \"not sufficient\" to support prosecution.

But in the head of Donald J. Trump, who knows?\" Conway also called for the Mueller report to be made public. \"But whether the Mueller report ever sees the light of day, there is one charge that can be resolved now,\" Conway wrote. \"Americans should expect far more from a president than merely that he not be provably a criminal.

MUST WATCH\nJussie Smollett: I've been truthful since day one 01:16 The Cook County State's Attorney's Office didn't immediately explain why the 16 counts of felony disorderly conduct were dropped, except to say the decision came after reviewing the case's facts -- and in view of Smollett's willingness to forfeit his $10,000 bond. \"After reviewing all of the facts and circumstances of the case, including Mr. Smollett's volunteer service in the community and agreement to forfeit his bond to the City of Chicago, we believe this outcome is a just disposition and appropriate resolution to this case,\" the state's attorney's office said in a statement. First Assistant State's Attorney Joseph Magats, the lead prosecutor, said he understood that people would question dropping the charges but that thousands of cases have similar resolutions. As Jussie Smollett proclaims innocence, mayor and police chief take aim at 'whitewash of justice' Magats said the charges would not have been dropped without the bond forfeiture and the community service factor. He added that Smollett had no prior felonies and wasn't a danger to the community. When asked whether he considered Smollett to be innocent, the prosecutor told CNN affiliate WLS: \"No.\" \"He was prosecuted. It may not have been the disposition that everybody thought would occur,\" Magats told WLS. \"He did do community service. He did forfeit $10,000. It's a fair and just disposition in the case.\" CNN has sought comment from Magats and the state's attorney's office. What did Smollett have to say about it? After a brief appearance in a Chicago courtroom, Smollett told reporters he was grateful to those who stood by him and that he wouldn't have put his family \"through a fire like this\" for a lie. \"I have been truthful and consistent on every single level since Day One,\" he said in a short statement. \"I would not be my mother's son if I was capable of one drop of what I've been accused of.\" His comments came weeks after he was indicted by a grand jury. Smollett had pleaded not guilty and denied any involvement in orchestrating an attack. Jussie Smollett's case may still cast a shadow over his career Smollett called himself a \"man of faith.\" He vowed to \"continue to fight for the justice, equality and betterment of marginalized people everywhere.\" Emanuel and Johnson spoke at a news conference later, reacting angrily to the latest developments. \"From top to bottom, this is not on the level. You have a person using hate crime laws that are on the books\" to promote himself, Emanuel said. \"Is there no decency in this man?\" Johnson said, \"If you want to say you're innocent of the situation, you take your day in court. ... I would never hide behind a brokered deal in secrecy, period.\" The superintendent said police learned about the dropped charges when the news was made public. Are the perpetrators of the attack still out there? JUST WATCHED Charges against Jussie Smollett dropped, attorneys say Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH\nCharges against Jussie Smollett dropped, attorneys say 01:17 Smollett's attorneys maintain that he was indeed attacked in Chicago on January 29. The actor reported to police that two men assaulted him near the lower entrance of a Loews hotel around 2 a.m. as he was walking back from getting something to eat. Smollett, who plays a gay character on the Fox drama, said the attackers yelled, \" 'Empire' fa***t'\" and \" 'Empire' n***er,\" while striking him, police said. The incident ended with a noose around his neck and bleach poured on him, police said. The actor also said one of the men shouted, \"This is MAGA country,\" a reference to President Donald Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" slogan, according to police. The many twists and turns in the Jussie Smollett investigation Police initially investigated the case as a possible hate crime. After police detained and interviewed two brothers described as \"persons of interest\" in the case in mid-February, Johnson said authorities suspected Smollett knew the men and allegedly paid them to stage the attack. Police said the brothers attacked Smollett at the actor's direction. The men were released without being charged. On Tuesday, Smollett attorney Patricia Brown Holmes insisted the brothers -- who she said were the actor's fitness trainers -- were the attackers. \"The two brothers have said that they attacked him,\" she said. \"(But) we don't want to try them in the press any more than\" Smollett wanted to be, she said. What happens to the brothers? Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo have expressed \"tremendous regret\" for their involvement in what the police called a staged attack. \"They understand how it has impacted people across the nation, particularly minority communities and especially those who have been victims of hate crimes themselves,\" Gloria Schmidt, an attorney for the brothers, said earlier this month. Police alleged that Smollett paid them $3,500 to stage the attack. Investigators believe Smollett orchestrated the attack \"because he was dissatisfied with his salary,\" Johnson said, citing information that the brothers gave to police. The brothers cooperated fully with the investigation and were no longer suspects, Chicago police said. They were released without charges after being arrested last month. Why did Smollett forfeit his bond? It may have been a strategic move. The Cook County State's Attorney's Office cited Smollett's agreement to forfeit his bond as a factor in explaining why the charges were dropped. But Emanuel told reporters that the $10,000 bond \"doesn't even come close\" to what the city spent investigating the alleged attack. Could the case be unsealed? Parts of the case have been sealed, one of Smollett's attorneys said. Holmes did not provide details about the order, only saying that the state dropped the charges and moved to \"seal the record in this case.\" Whether or not all the case files remain sealed, we may never know what actually happened.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D), one of the leading voices for the legislation, went off on those who mock the effort as nothing more than an elitist fantasy.\nIt began when Wisconsin Rep. Sean Duffy (R) introduced an amendment in a meeting of the Financial Services Committee that would force a homelessness bill that was being debated to meet \"green\" standards. \"The Green New Deal is one that if you are a rich liberal from maybe New York or California it sounds great because you can afford to retrofit your home or build a new home that has a zero emissions, that is energy efficient, affordable and safe,\" he said. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE!\nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\nCue AOC. You should watch the entire two minutes of what she said , but here's the key part: \"When we talk about the concern for the environment as an elitist concern, one year ago I was waitressing in a taco shop in downtown Manhattan. I just got health insurance for the first time a month ago. This is not an elitist issue. This is a quality of life issue. You want to tell people that their concern and their desire for clean air and clean water is elitist? Tell that to the kids in the South Bronx which are suffering from the highest rates of childhood asthma in the country. Tell that to the families in Flint whose kids, their blood is ascending in lead levels, their brains are damaged for the rest of their lives. Call them elitist. You're telling them that those kids are trying to get on a plane to Davos? People are dying!\" The clip of Ocasio-Cortez's speech, which was tweeted by liberal activist Brian Tyler Cohen at 8:32 p.m. Eastern Tuesday night , already has 4.7 million views. It had been retweeted almost 50,000 times and had almost 125,000 likes as of Wednesday morning. Read More Watch every second of this... @AOC is so incredibly spot on. pic.twitter.com/ESP4dC5TTo\n\u2014 Brian Tyler Cohen (@briantylercohen) March 27, 2019 Those are absolutely staggering numbers. But they speak to the chord that AOC has touched among liberals in the country. She is, without any question, one of the biggest stars in the Democratic Party at the moment -- and that includes the roughly 73 candidates who are running for president at the moment. (Here's one anecdote that speaks to the Ocasio-Cortez sensation: At the SXSW festival earlier this month in Austin, Texas, the line to get into to see her speak ran the length of two full floors of a massive convention center. I went to a live taping of Binge Mode's \"Talk the Thrones\" which was happening at the same time. Got to get that \"Game of Thrones\" content!) And the clip above shows why. Unlike some Democrats who shrink when attacked as elitists by Republicans, Ocasio-Cortez takes that charge on directly -- by leaning heavily into her own personal story. It is a remarkable story of an unbelievably rapid ascent into the upper echelons of national Democratic politics. And it is a story rooted not in fancy schools or a stack of graduate degrees but rather in AOC's own very middle class life prior to being elected to Congress. It resonates with Democrats because it is authentic. Then there is the fact, as the clip demonstrates, that AOC is not willing to let herself or the issues she cares about be stereotyped by Republicans. Climate change isn't about the carbon footprint Al Gore leaves when he jets into Davos to deliver a speech, argues Ocasio-Cortez. Instead it's about kids in places like New York City and Flint, Michigan whose lives are being negatively affected -- and in possibly permanent ways by a lack of clean air and clean water. You can see it all -- the smarts, the unapologetic nature and the passionate conviction -- in that clip. For all the devotion and plaudits AOC draws on the left, she pulls in just as much derision and anger on the right. Of Ocasio-Cortez's speech on Tuesday night, the conservative New York Post headlined their story \" Ocasio-Cortez flips out after congressman calls Green New Deal 'elitist' .\" Fox News' writeup of the back and forth was titled \" AOC bristles as GOP lawmaker blasts Green New Deal as 'elitist' pet project of rich liberals .\" Politicians who generate passion -- among their supporters, yes, but also among their opponents -- are a very rare breed. And usually the ones who make the most noise in national politics. Ocasio-Cortez isn't yet 30 years old but she's already achieved that status.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/user/CNN?sub_confirmation=1", "https://bulletin.cnn.io", "https://nypost.com/2019/03/27/ocasio-cortez-flips-out-after-congressman-calls-green-new-deal-elitist/", "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ocasio-cortez-forced-to-defend-green-new-deal-after-gop-congressman-says-its-elitist-favored-by-rich-liberals", "https://twitter.com/AOC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "https://twitter.com/briantylercohen/status/1110700996282343424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://t.co/ESP4dC5TTo", "https://twitter.com/briantylercohen/status/1110700996282343424", "https://www.theringer.com/binge-mode"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "chris cillizza", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sean duffy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexandria ocasio-cortez", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "alexandria ocasio-cortez", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "financial services committee", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wisconsin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-03-27T15:42:34.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d996f091a5f525256d308d97614ee29a341b560a", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/27/politics/joe-biden-white-mans-culture/index.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rss%2Fcnn_topstories+%28RSS%3A+CNN+-+Top+Stories%29", "site_full": "edition.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel - HP Hero", "title": "Joe Biden criticizes 'white man's culture' as he talks violence against women - CNNPolitics", "title_full": "Joe Biden criticizes 'white man's culture' as he talks violence against women - CNNPolitics", "published": "2019-03-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190327083130-02-joe-biden-03162019-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 9, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 5014, "comments": 3727, "shares": 923}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "eb2c9a7e417cf289b994d770c073604b5d3a83f6", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/27/politics/joe-biden-white-mans-culture/index.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Arlette Saenz", "published": "2019-03-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Joe Biden criticizes 'white man's culture' as he talks violence against women - CNNPolitics", "text": "(CNN) Former Vice President Joe Biden urged Americans to tackle a \"white man's culture\" dating back centuries that has allowed violence against women to perpetuate.\nBiden has long worked to prevent violence against women, but his comments are notable coming amid speculation that he is close to entering the 2020 Democratic presidential field, the most diverse in history. \"We all have an obligation to do nothing less than change the culture in this country,\" Biden said at an event at the Russian Tea Room in New York City Tuesday night, which was hosted by the Biden Foundation and It's On Us, honoring students who have worked to end sexual assault on college campuses. \"This is English jurisprudential culture, a white man's culture. It's got to change.\" Biden regrets that Anita Hill 'paid a terrible price': 'I wish I could have done something' The former vice president also lamented his role in the 1991 confirmation hearings of Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas, during which Anita Hill alleged she faced sexual harassment by Thomas. At the time, Biden was a Delaware senator who was chairing the Senate Judiciary Committee, and progressives have since criticized his handling of the hearings into her accusations, which ultimately did not derail Thomas' ascension to the Supreme Court. \"We knew a lot less about the extent of harassment back then, over 30 years ago. She paid a terrible price. She was abused for the hearing. She was taken advantage of. Her reputation was attacked. I wish I could have done something,\" Biden said Tuesday. \"To this day, I regret I couldn't come up with a way to get her the kind of hearing she deserved, given the courage she showed by reaching out to us.\" Read More Biden noted there was a \"real and perceived problem the committee faced. They were a bunch of white guys.\" He added that when Hill, who is African-American, \"came and testified, she faced a committee that didn't fully understand what the hell it was all about.\" Biden's statement drew some criticism on social media from progressives, who believe he could have done more in his role overseeing the hearings. Cillizza: Joe Biden's Anita Hill apology is a reminder of his biggest 2020 weakness \"It literally does not matter what else Biden says about sexual assault if he cannot acknowledge his own culpability in putting a sexual assaulter on the Supereme Court and then pretending for years like he was powerless to stop it. #BelieveSurvivors #IBelieveAnita,\" Jess Morales Rocketto, political director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, tweeted. Biden's expression of regret comes as he nears a decision on whether he'll mount a presidential bid for the third time. His handling of the Hill testimony is one of the many areas of Biden's career that is set to come under fresh scrutiny, particularly in the wake of the #MeToo movement.

And, based on that, my lawyers believe, as they are the ones who formally submitted the application, that there's a basis for a pardon,\" he said. Papadopoulos rejected FBI request to wear wire for professor claiming Russian 'dirt' Papadopoulos has released a new book, titled \"Deep State Target,\" in which he claims that he did not actually lie to the FBI about his contacts with the professor, Joseph Mifsud, but rather was pressured into a plea agreement by Mueller's team. Mueller, in Papadopoulos' court proceedings, said Papadopoulos' lies to the FBI in early 2017 were intentional and hurt the agency's ability to question, detain or arrest Mifsud when he was in Washington, DC, around that time. Read More \"I realize that I misspoke to the FBI, but I wasn't lying to hide anything,\" Papadopoulos wrote. \"The 'lie' I was charged with ... certainly wasn't intentional.\" In addition to lying about his communications while he served on the campaign, Papadopoulos also deactivated his Facebook account and got a new cell phone after the FBI questioned him, further obscuring his communications with Mifsud and another Russian contact, a woman. Papadopoulos, as a campaign adviser in 2016, had discussed with the woman the possibility that then-candidate Trump could meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin on a foreign policy trip to Russia. The former Trump adviser also claimed he was \"faced with a choice: accept the charges that I lied or face FARA charges,\" referencing the US law regulating lobbying on behalf of foreign governments. \"I made a deal. A deal forced on me.\" At his sentencing, Papadopoulos read a mea culpa, admitting that he had hurt the federal investigation into Russian influence in the 2016 presidential election and expressing regret for lying to federal investigators. The judge was lenient, noting that he believed Papadopoulos' remorse. He was ultimately sentenced to two weeks. Papadopoulos said on \"New Day\" Wednesday he \"would never ask (for a pardon) personally,\" but noted that his lawyers are seeking one because they're \"looking out for my legal interests.\" \"If I'm offered one, I would honorably accept it,\" he told Berman. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters Monday morning that there had been no discussions about potential pardons related to the Russia investigation. Mueller did not find that Trump's campaign or associates conspired with Russia, according to Attorney General William Barr's summary of the report submitted to Congress on Sunday. Mueller's investigation of whether the President committed obstruction of justice did not conclude the President committed a crime, but it also \"does not exonerate him,\" Barr wrote, quoting from Mueller's report. Mueller did not make the decision himself on whether to prosecute the President on obstruction.

In 2016, Trump broke with decades of tradition and refused to release his tax returns, claiming he was under Internal Revenue Service audit. Trump's decision to forgo releasing his tax returns has incensed Democrats and ethics watchdogs, who accuse the President of hiding his assets that could indicate conflicts of interest. \"And now, as we fight to defeat Donald Trump, we need honesty, transparency and accountability more than ever. That's why Kirsten has posted her tax returns from the last 12 years here for all to see. And she's calling on every candidate in the Democratic field to follow her lead and release theirs, too,\" her campaign website reads, along with links to her past tax returns dating back to 2007. Read More Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has publicly released the past 10 years of her tax returns and has also called on \"every other candidate for President to do exactly the same thing\" in a tweet and online petition. She has not yet released her 2018 tax return, though the tax season ends on April 15. Democrats are starting to get antsy about the push for Trump's tax returns Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders recently promised to release 10 years of his tax returns, but he has not provide a timeline of when he'd do so. \"Soon,\" he told CNN's Wolf Blitzer during a CNN town hall last month . Asked what the delay was, Sanders said, \"It just was a mechanical issue. We don't have accountants at home. My wife does most of it and we will get that stuff out.\" Tax returns provide a fuller picture of a presidential candidate's financial state including sources of income, the candidates' tax rate, any charitable donations or foreign accounts. Prior to Trump, every president since Richard Nixon had released their tax returns, with the exception of Gerald Ford, who instead shared a decade's worth of summary data about his federal taxes. Some major party candidates have released decades' worth of returns, while others have only made the top two pages of their federal Form 1040 public. The Democratic-led House recently passed a sweeping legislative proposal that mandates the disclosure of presidential tax returns.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kirsten gillibrand", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "alisyn camerota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gillibrand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "internal revenue service", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-03-27T15:42:41.041+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4b05a0f9989ff2978d7cc4bdfd5a62c6a6c396d8", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/27/us/powerball-jackpot-750-million-wednesday/index.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rss%2Fcnn_topstories+%28RSS%3A+CNN+-+Top+Stories%29", "site_full": "edition.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel - HP Hero", "title": "Powerball jackpot soars to $750 million.

For two decades, Jakobshavn sustained remarkably consistent thinning that scientists thought would continue, if not accelerate, due to large-scale warming of the polar atmosphere and oceans -- but that rate dramatically slowed in 2014, and the glacier actually thickened between 2016 and 2017 and again between 2017 and 2018, according to a study published Monday in the journal Nature. \"At first we didn't believe it,\" said Ala Khazendar, the lead NASA scientist on the study. \"We had pretty much assumed that Jakobshavn would just keep going on as it had over the last 20 years.\" A close-up of the Jakobshavn glacier. Jakobshavn Isbrae, the full name of the glacier along Western Greenland's coast, has been Greenland's fastest-flowing and largest ice-losing glacier over the past 20 years, making it by far the single largest contributor to sea level rise on the large, mostly frozen island. Read More In fact, according to Khazendar, the melting from that single glacier alone contributed to global oceans rising an average of 1 millimeter between 2000 and 2010. And even though Jakobshavn has gained ice at lowest levels where it enters the sea, it has still been contributing to sea level rise because the rate it is melting into the ocean is still greater than the rate that ice is accumulating higher up on the glacier, according to the researchers. The glacier controls a basin with enough ice, that if melted fully, would raise global oceans by about 2 feet. CNN Interactive: Global Warning It is this threat, and the rapid speed with which Jakobshavn had been shredding ice over the past several decades, that has led droves of scientists to the icy coastline and makes the glacier one of, if not the most, studied glaciers in the world. Khazendar, along with a team of other scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, used a number of datasets from NASA that analyze Greenland's ice, oceans and atmosphere, including those from recent targeted research missions called Oceans Melting Greenland and Operation Ice Bridge, to determine the likely cause of Jakobshavn's recent about-face. Cooler waters chilled Jakobshavn's advance Scientists attributed the ice gain to localized ocean cooling. Between 2014 and 2016, waters up to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) cooler entered Disko Bay, where Jakobshavn glacier enters the water. Researchers believe that the cooling is related to a natural variation in the climate in the Northern Hemisphere known as the North Atlantic Oscillation, which can warm or cool the northern portions of the Atlantic Ocean in periods of several years (not too dissimilar from the impact that El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a can have on Pacific Ocean temperatures). A view of the Jakobshavn Glacier from the window of a NASA research plane. Through detailed observations, Khazendar and team were able to track this cooler water from the open North Atlantic all the way to Disko Bay and found that the timing matched the glacier's switch towards gaining ice perfectly. \"In the last two or three years, the ocean's role was dominant,\" Khazendar said. But in the late 1990s, it was much warmer water that entered the bay that melted the ice shelf that had been protecting Jakobshavn glacier, setting off the unparalleled melting that characterized the glacier for the next two decades. \"It is like an experiment 20 years in the making,\" Khazendar said. He said the glacier's dramatic response to variations in ocean temperature is forcing scientists to reevaluate how sensitive glaciers are to slight changes in the ocean's climate. A reprieve, not a resurrection The cooling of the Northern Atlantic is a blip on the radar, a localized effect that will eventually turn warmer as the North Atlantic Oscillation flips back. This will take place at the same time as climate change turns up the thermostat on earth's oceans. \"This is a reprieve,\" Khazendar said of the recent thickening of Jakobshavn glacier, \"not a resurrection.\" Scientists caution not to read too much into the news of one the most critical glaciers in the world suddenly, and unexpectedly, gaining ice. \"The response of a single glacier does not imply that things have shifted,\" said Marco Tedesco, a research professor with Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. \"Greenland is currently [losing] about 270 gigatons (a gigaton is a billion tons) of ice per year...its mass loss has been accelerating over the past decades, with Greenland being the single largest contributor to sea level rise,\" Tedesco, who was not involved in the new research, wrote in an email. Eric Rignot, a glaciologist at the University of California, Irvine and senior research scientist at JPL, noted that \"The chances that this will keep going on are very low in my opinion. It is only a matter of time before the glacier starts thinning again -- maybe this summer, maybe next year.\" Global warning: Arctic melt Presidential tweets on climate change notwithstanding, a few cold days in one part of the world does not negate an overall warming trend of the entire planet. We \"should not confuse climate with local variability,\" said Rignot, who was not involved in the research. \"The latter is what we are seeing here.\" The findings show that glaciers are extremely vulnerable to temperatures, both hot and cold, and that is not good news for the future. Most of the heat from global warming is going straight into the oceans -- studies show more than 90% -- and that is resulting in global ocean heat levels that are climbing higher every year. \"Next time the warm waters come back to Jakobshavn, they will be even warmer,\" Khazendar said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-019-0329-3", "https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/icebridge/index.html", "https://omg.jpl.nasa.gov/portal/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jakobshavn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jakobshavn isbrae", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ala khazendar", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nasa", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "jakobshavn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greenland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "western greenland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-03-27T15:43:09.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b3e923c312a64e9d903b715d75a983fae2e6f989", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/27/sport/dubai-world-cup-richest-horse-racing-winning-post-uae-spt-intl/index.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rss%2Fcnn_latest+%28RSS%3A+CNN+-+Most+Recent%29", "site_full": "edition.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_latest.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "Dubai World Cup returns with $35 million prize purse - CNN", "title_full": "Dubai World Cup returns with $35 million prize purse - CNN", "published": "2019-03-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180401092343-dubai-world-cup-godolphin-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 67, "comments": 21, "shares": 76}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "125652dfca02f2a4552fe8f49fcb12fd1331de7d", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/27/sport/dubai-world-cup-richest-horse-racing-winning-post-uae-spt-intl/index.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ben Church, CNN", "published": "2019-03-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Dubai World Cup returns with $35 million prize purse - CNN", "text": "Story highlights Dubai World Cup is set for March 30 The meeting offers a $35 million purse Pop star Gwen Stefani is due to perform (CNN) Boasting the most expensive prize purse in horse racing, it's no wonder the Dubai World Cup attracts the very best of the equine world.\nHeld at the Meydan Racecourse, the prestigious meeting marks the end of the UAE racing season, bringing together the world's top jockeys, trainers and thoroughbreds.

Marcus is founding co-director of the National Preparedness Leadership Initiative, a joint program of the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health and the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, Center for Public Leadership. Eric J. McNulty serves as associate director for the National Preparedness Leadership Initiative and the Harvard T. H. Chan Program for Health Care Negotiation and Conflict Resolution. The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own.\nOne crucial thing that you don't get back in a crisis is time. After two crashes on its 737 Max 8 aircraft that killed everyone on board \u2014 just months apart \u2014 Boeing has lost a lot of time, and it can't afford to waste any more. For days, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg's most visible action was a reported call to President Trump to vouch for the plane's safety. This drove rampant speculation that he was trying to forestall government action, which he ultimately failed to do. And the company's lobbying activity and $1 million donation to Trump's inaugural committee certainly hasn't helped quell that speculation. If nothing else, the company and its executives look obsessed with their short-term business interests. It may be too late for Boeing to be the hero in this story, though it can counter its depiction as villain. Boeing must be more proactive than reactive if it hopes to recapture public trust and rebuild brand value. Its move to develop a software patch and support pilot training on the new systems are good steps, but there's more the company can do. Remember timing matters Boeing made serious timing missteps. It was not until March 18 \u2014 eight days after the Ethiopian Airlines crash \u2014 that Muilenburg embraced the emotional weight of the unfolding events in a video statement . It was excellent in its sentiment. However, it was late, coming five days after Southwest Airlines CEO Gary Kelly released a compassionate video. Boeing should have been first, not last, to the table. Read More More Perspectives on Management & Leadership 4 signs a company is a good employer for women\nShell is tying executive pay to carbon emissions. Here's why it could create real impact\nAmerica is facing a leadership crisis. It's on us to fix it\nOf course, company lawyers worry about what the company and its executives say or do in the days following a crisis. They will have to deal with the inevitable litigation and investigations in which this all becomes evidence. However, in limiting itself to dry statements for several days, Boeing created an \"empathy gap\" where it appeared cold and uncaring rather than acknowledging the pain, uncertainty and concern felt by the loved ones of those who died in the two crashes. The most important steps to take now are to listen and thoughtfully respond. It is time for dialogue, not monologue. Listen to the families. Listen to the pilots. Boeing has invited pilots and regulators to briefings. Beyond that, it must respond with tangible actions that reflect the concerns of those stakeholders and help to prevent similar incidents in the future. Focus on the company's future reputation Reputation is a long-term consideration. Boeing's once unblemished reputation \u2014 which it spent years building \u2014 has been shattered. Passengers who may have given little attention to the make and model of an aircraft will now look much more closely, and each action Boeing takes today will affect how people view the company for years to come. As the leader of a company, you have to put the organization's mission and welfare above your self-interest. That's what you sign up for.\"\nLeonard J. Marcus and Eric J. McNulty\nThe best guide is former Johnson & Johnson CEO James Burke's response to the Tylenol poisonings in 1982. When three people died in the Chicago area after taking Tylenol, Burke shaped the company's future with a nationwide recall of the product. He went big and moved fast with the company's response, putting consumer confidence above short-term sales. Burke's efforts became an enduring exemplar of crisis response by a CEO. Muilenburg needs to focus on the future. He must emphasize transparency, humility and authenticity. He must demonstrate to every stakeholder that the company is \u2014 and will be \u2014 fully trustworthy. He must prove that nothing will keep him from making things right. That starts with more listening, this time to employees. We assume that no one at Boeing willfully put passenger safety at risk. Yet forces, perhaps competitive pressures, may have caused some to underestimate risk and overestimate the robustness of internal controls. The answers are inside the company, and Boeing's reputation will need to be rebuilt from the inside-out. The company must regain confidence in itself through relentless root cause analysis. If it hasn't done so already, it should gather all of its employees together and have a brutally honest conversation about how decisions were made that led to this outcome. Reverse engineer what will be Muilenburg should assign teams to rapidly work through two scenarios: Best case, it is 2025 and Boeing is the most trusted name in aviation. Worst case, it's 2025 and Boeing is out of business. The teams should then work backwards to March 2019 to trace the steps that led to each outcome. Facing such stark and divergent futures will illuminate strategic and tactical choices to be made today \u2014 and in the weeks and months ahead. It is better to stare into the abyss than to step into it blindly. Of course, if Boeing did not act in good faith in deploying the 737 Max and the Justice Department's investigation discovers Boeing cut corners or attempted to avoid proper regulatory reviews of the modifications to the aircraft, Muilenburg and any other executives involved should resign immediately. Too many families, indeed communities, depend on the continued viability of Boeing. As the leader of a company, you have to put the organization's mission and welfare above your self-interest.

The gap also narrowed compared to the year before. It decreased by $1.9 billion, or 3.7%, from January 2018. Most of the increase can be explained by a 14% drop in the trade deficit in China, America's largest trading partner. In part, that's due to US importers pulling back after rushing to buy Chinese goods ahead of possible tariff increases. President Donald Trump had threatened to raise the duty rate in March, but it never materialized. Soybean farmers are still paying for Trump's trade war The January data also shows a rise in soybean purchases from China. Beijing had stopped buying soybeans from American farmers last year in retaliation to Trump's tariffs. But the Chinese bought $1.2 billion of soybeans in January, up from just $299 million during the previous month, the Census report said. Read More The US trade deficit is pulling back from the widest level seen in a decade. It hit a record high in December and has grown by more than $100 billion since Trump took office. Trump says China tariffs may stay for 'a substantial period of time' The President has made it a priority to shrink the trade deficit, which he uses as a measure of whether the United States is winning or losing on trade. He's argued that bad trade deals have allowed other countries to take advantage of the United States. Last year, he imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods. The duties were meant to pressure Beijing to come to the negotiating table by encouraging Americans to buy less from China. But there are other factors that affect the country's trade deficit besides tariffs. Last year's federal tax cuts have put more money back into Americans' pockets, lifting demand for imports even if they're more expensive.

The charges included one count of a hate crime act that resulted in the death of 32-year-old Heather Heyer, and 28 counts of hate crime acts that caused bodily injury and involved an attempt to kill other people in the crowd, the Department of Justice said. Fields had previously pleaded not guilty to those charges, as well as a charge of racially motivated violent interference with a federally protected activity. Heather Heyer's killer facing centuries in prison, but his legal saga isn't over Attorney General Bill Barr and US Attorney Thomas T. Cullen both said Fields committed an act of domestic terrorism when he drove into a crowd of protesters that August day. Read More \"In the aftermath of the mass murder in New Zealand earlier this month, we are reminded that a diverse and pluralistic community such as ours can have zero tolerance for violence on the basis of race, religion, or association with people of other races and religions,\" Barr said. A Virginia jury in December found Fields guilty of killing Heyer, among other crimes, and recommended a sentence of life in prison. That sentencing hearing, previously scheduled for Friday, has been continued to July 15, Commonwealth's Attorney Joseph Platania said. Fields' attorney did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. Fields 'drove directly into the crowd,' feds allege According to the federal indictment , Fields took to social media before the rally on August 12, 2017, and \"expressed and promoted his belief that white people are superior to other races and peoples; expressed support of the social and racial policies of Adolf Hitler and Nazi-era Germany, including the Holocaust; and espoused violence against African Americans, Jewish people and members of other racial, ethnic and religious groups he perceived to be non-white.\" FBI stats on hate crimes are scary. So is what's missing The day before the rally, as Fields prepared to leave his home in Maumee, Ohio, to travel to Charlottesville, he got a text from a family member urging him to be careful, the indictment says. \"We're not the ones who need to be careful,\" Fields responded, attaching a photo of Hitler, according to the indictment. Once in Charlottesville, Fields joined protesters who had gathered to denounce the removal of a Confederate statue from a city park in \"chants promoting or expressing white supremacist and other racist and anti-Semitic views,\" the indictment says.

At the time, Biden was a Delaware senator who was chairing the Senate Judiciary Committee, and progressives have since criticized his handling of the hearings into her accusations, which ultimately did not derail Thomas' ascension to the Supreme Court. \"We knew a lot less about the extent of harassment back then, over 30 years ago. She paid a terrible price. She was abused for the hearing. She was taken advantage of. Her reputation was attacked. I wish I could have done something,\" Biden said Tuesday. \"To this day, I regret I couldn't come up with a way to get her the kind of hearing she deserved, given the courage she showed by reaching out to us.\" Read More Biden noted there was a \"real and perceived problem the committee faced.

Biden's expression of regret comes as he nears a decision on whether he'll mount a presidential bid for the third time. His handling of the Hill testimony is one of the many areas of Biden's career that is set to come under fresh scrutiny, particularly in the wake of the #MeToo movement.

But he didn't stay stateside for long. \"The civilian life just didn't do it for him,\" his father, Jack Atkins, said in a video about his son's service. \"He had to get back in the Army.\" Atkins re-enlisted in December 2005 and was killed in action as a 10th Mountain Division squad leader in Abu Samak, Iraq, on June 1, 2007. During a routine route security check, Atkins and three of his fellow soldiers received a call about four suspicious-looking men. Read More \"We fired up the truck, we sped down there,\" then-Pfc. Sand Aijo, who was one of the three soldiers in Atkins' Humvee that day, told reporters at the Pentagon Tuesday. \"Travis exited the vehicle. He started giving verbal commands to the men. ... I start to notice Travis begin hand-to-hand combat with this man. You could tell it was almost like wrestling when you hand fight and trying to get control of the man. All of a sudden I see Travis wrap the guy up and he lifted him up and he slams him the ground,\" Aijo recalled. Atkins realized the Iraqi man was wearing a suicide vest. \"Once they hit the ground, the way Travis began positioning his body, it just wasn't -- it seemed strange to me, he kind of began to position himself, while still, mind you, holding this guy down,\" Aijo said, describing how Atkins pinned the man strategically away from him and the other soldiers. \"That's when the detonation happened.\" Aijo explained that the vest was a grenade-detonated suicide vest, meaning Atkins would have seen and understood there would be a few-second delay before the explosion. \"He had a split second to make that decision and that was the decision he made -- to sacrifice himself so that we could all live,\" Aijo said. The explosion killed Atkins instantly. He was 31 years old, the father of a young son. His action saved the lives of his three fellow soldiers. \"I witnessed the heroics that ultimately saved my life and the lives of several others,\" Aijo said, adding, \"Travis was an amazing soldier. He was an amazing brother to us. He loved his country, but even more so, I got to know the man -- I'm proud to be a part of this and to get to celebrate Travis today. I wouldn't be here without him.\" Former Staff Sgt. Stuart Hollingsworth, who was Atkins' platoon leader, recalled his leadership. \"He was a selfless leader. Travis was an authoritative leader. He led by example and knowledge, not through fear or title or rank,\" Hollingsworth said Tuesday at the Pentagon. Atkins received a posthumous Distinguished Service Cross for his actions, but after a review beginning in 2016, the Department of Defense upgraded the honor to the Medal of Honor, the nation's highest military decoration. The President will present the Medal of Honor to Atkins' son, Trevor Oliver, in the East Room of the White House Wednesday afternoon. Trump spoke to Oliver by phone to inform him that Atkins would be awarded the Medal of Honor. Atkins' parents, Jack and Elaine Atkins, will also attend the ceremony, as well as many of Atkins' fellow service members. \"Yes, my dad's gone and that's hard,\" Oliver said . \"But what he did is so extreme and that just moves me even more. He was my icon ... He was a great soldier, and a great father.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3O9fCxI0NAA", "https://www.army.mil/article/217873?utm_source=mrd&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=mohatkins"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "travis atkins", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "travis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atkins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack atkins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sand aijo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "army", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pentagon", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "montana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iraq", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abu samak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kuwait", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-03-27T16:39:06.064+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e0a13be6fc5a66bdf8768e1f40eef9ff65009653", "url": "http://us.cnn.com/2019/03/27/politics/george-papadopoulos-pardon-cnntv/index.html", "site_full": "us.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://us.cnn.com/us", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "US News \u2013 Top national stories and latest headlines - CNN", "title": "Papadopoulos says lawyers are seeking pardon because of public 'misunderstanding' about him - CNNPolitics", "title_full": "Papadopoulos says lawyers are seeking pardon because of public 'misunderstanding' about him - CNNPolitics", "published": "2019-03-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181125145433-george-papadopoulos-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e0a13be6fc5a66bdf8768e1f40eef9ff65009653", "url": "http://us.cnn.com/2019/03/27/politics/george-papadopoulos-pardon-cnntv/index.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Devan Cole", "published": "2019-03-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Papadopoulos says lawyers are seeking pardon because of public 'misunderstanding' about him - CNNPolitics", "text": "Washington (CNN) Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, who pleaded guilty in 2017 to lying to the FBI about his contacts with a professor who had ties to Russia, said Wednesday his legal team is seeking a pardon from President Donald Trump in order to clear his name.\n\"There's been so much disinformation and misunderstanding about who George Papadopoulos is, how he actually fits into (special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation) in the proper context and what he was doing for the Trump campaign and Trump transition team,\" Papadopoulos told CNN's John Berman on \"New Day.\" \"So I am simply getting the facts out there for the public to consume, for the media to consume and then for them to articulate something completely different than has been said about me for the past two years. And, based on that, my lawyers believe, as they are the ones who formally submitted the application, that there's a basis for a pardon,\" he said. Papadopoulos rejected FBI request to wear wire for professor claiming Russian 'dirt' Papadopoulos has released a new book, titled \"Deep State Target,\" in which he claims that he did not actually lie to the FBI about his contacts with the professor, Joseph Mifsud, but rather was pressured into a plea agreement by Mueller's team. Mueller, in Papadopoulos' court proceedings, said Papadopoulos' lies to the FBI in early 2017 were intentional and hurt the agency's ability to question, detain or arrest Mifsud when he was in Washington, DC, around that time. Read More \"I realize that I misspoke to the FBI, but I wasn't lying to hide anything,\" Papadopoulos wrote. \"The 'lie' I was charged with ... certainly wasn't intentional.\" In addition to lying about his communications while he served on the campaign, Papadopoulos also deactivated his Facebook account and got a new cell phone after the FBI questioned him, further obscuring his communications with Mifsud and another Russian contact, a woman. Papadopoulos, as a campaign adviser in 2016, had discussed with the woman the possibility that then-candidate Trump could meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin on a foreign policy trip to Russia. The former Trump adviser also claimed he was \"faced with a choice: accept the charges that I lied or face FARA charges,\" referencing the US law regulating lobbying on behalf of foreign governments. \"I made a deal. A deal forced on me.\" At his sentencing, Papadopoulos read a mea culpa, admitting that he had hurt the federal investigation into Russian influence in the 2016 presidential election and expressing regret for lying to federal investigators. The judge was lenient, noting that he believed Papadopoulos' remorse. He was ultimately sentenced to two weeks. Papadopoulos said on \"New Day\" Wednesday he \"would never ask (for a pardon) personally,\" but noted that his lawyers are seeking one because they're \"looking out for my legal interests.\" \"If I'm offered one, I would honorably accept it,\" he told Berman. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters Monday morning that there had been no discussions about potential pardons related to the Russia investigation. Mueller did not find that Trump's campaign or associates conspired with Russia, according to Attorney General William Barr's summary of the report submitted to Congress on Sunday. Mueller's investigation of whether the President committed obstruction of justice did not conclude the President committed a crime, but it also \"does not exonerate him,\" Barr wrote, quoting from Mueller's report. Mueller did not make the decision himself on whether to prosecute the President on obstruction. Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein made the determination the evidence was \"not sufficient\" to support prosecution.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "george papadopoulos", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "papadopoulos", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert mueller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john berman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "fbi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-03-27T16:39:18.032+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9aa6c3d3a675d74b53ec98da96c25cc4ea47e5e0", "url": "http://us.cnn.com/2019/03/27/politics/barbara-bush-biography-book-republican-party-melania-trump-letter/index.html", "site_full": "us.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://us.cnn.com/us", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "US News \u2013 Top national stories and latest headlines - CNN", "title": "USA Today: Barbara Bush no longer considered herself a Republican after Trump became President, book says - CNNPolitics", "title_full": "USA Today: Barbara Bush no longer considered herself a Republican after Trump became President, book says - CNNPolitics", "published": "2019-03-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 1.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180417112532-barbara-bush-endorsing-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9aa6c3d3a675d74b53ec98da96c25cc4ea47e5e0", "url": "http://us.cnn.com/2019/03/27/politics/barbara-bush-biography-book-republican-party-melania-trump-letter/index.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Veronica Stracqualursi", "published": "2019-03-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "USA Today: Barbara Bush no longer considered herself a Republican after Trump became President, book says - CNNPolitics", "text": "Programming note: For more on the Bush family legacy, watch CNN's Original Series \"The Bush Years,\" Sundays at 10pm ET. Washington (CNN) Former first lady Barbara Bush didn't consider herself a Republican after Donald Trump took office, according to a forthcoming book obtained by USA Today about the matriarch of a GOP political dynasty.\n\"After Trump's rise, she saw it as a party she could not continue to support, a party she no longer recognized -- even as one of her grandsons, George P. Bush, was on the ballot as a Republican running for re-election as Texas land commissioner,\" author Susan Page wrote in an excerpt adapted from her new book, \"The Matriarch: Barbara Bush and the Making of an American Dynasty.\" The excerpt was published Wednesday in USA Today . Future of the Bush dynasty: Service? Yes. White House? Maybe Bush had answered \"yes\" when asked in October 2017 whether she was a Republican, according to Page, who interviewed the former first lady in the final months of her life before she died last April . When asked the same question by Page four months later, when Trump was in office, Bush replied: \"I'd probably say no today.\" Photos: The life of former first lady Barbara Bush Photos: The life of former first lady Barbara Bush Former first lady Barbara Bush , the matriarch of a Republican political dynasty and a first lady who elevated the cause of literacy, died April 17, 2018, at age 92.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D), one of the leading voices for the legislation, went off on those who mock the effort as nothing more than an elitist fantasy.\nIt began when Wisconsin Rep. Sean Duffy (R) introduced an amendment in a meeting of the Financial Services Committee that would force a homelessness bill that was being debated to meet \"green\" standards. \"The Green New Deal is one that if you are a rich liberal from maybe New York or California it sounds great because you can afford to retrofit your home or build a new home that has a zero emissions, that is energy efficient, affordable and safe,\" he said. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE!\nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\nCue AOC. You should watch the entire two minutes of what she said , but here's the key part: \"When we talk about the concern for the environment as an elitist concern, one year ago I was waitressing in a taco shop in downtown Manhattan. I just got health insurance for the first time a month ago. This is not an elitist issue. This is a quality of life issue. You want to tell people that their concern and their desire for clean air and clean water is elitist? Tell that to the kids in the South Bronx which are suffering from the highest rates of childhood asthma in the country. Tell that to the families in Flint whose kids, their blood is ascending in lead levels, their brains are damaged for the rest of their lives. Call them elitist. You're telling them that those kids are trying to get on a plane to Davos? People are dying!\" The clip of Ocasio-Cortez's speech, which was tweeted by liberal activist Brian Tyler Cohen at 8:32 p.m. Eastern Tuesday night , already has 4.7 million views. It had been retweeted almost 50,000 times and had almost 125,000 likes as of Wednesday morning. Read More Watch every second of this... @AOC is so incredibly spot on. pic.twitter.com/ESP4dC5TTo\n\u2014 Brian Tyler Cohen (@briantylercohen) March 27, 2019 Those are absolutely staggering numbers. But they speak to the chord that AOC has touched among liberals in the country. She is, without any question, one of the biggest stars in the Democratic Party at the moment -- and that includes the roughly 73 candidates who are running for president at the moment. (Here's one anecdote that speaks to the Ocasio-Cortez sensation: At the SXSW festival earlier this month in Austin, Texas, the line to get into to see her speak ran the length of two full floors of a massive convention center. I went to a live taping of Binge Mode's \"Talk the Thrones\" which was happening at the same time. Got to get that \"Game of Thrones\" content!) And the clip above shows why. Unlike some Democrats who shrink when attacked as elitists by Republicans, Ocasio-Cortez takes that charge on directly -- by leaning heavily into her own personal story. It is a remarkable story of an unbelievably rapid ascent into the upper echelons of national Democratic politics. And it is a story rooted not in fancy schools or a stack of graduate degrees but rather in AOC's own very middle class life prior to being elected to Congress. It resonates with Democrats because it is authentic. Then there is the fact, as the clip demonstrates, that AOC is not willing to let herself or the issues she cares about be stereotyped by Republicans. Climate change isn't about the carbon footprint Al Gore leaves when he jets into Davos to deliver a speech, argues Ocasio-Cortez. Instead it's about kids in places like New York City and Flint, Michigan whose lives are being negatively affected -- and in possibly permanent ways by a lack of clean air and clean water. You can see it all -- the smarts, the unapologetic nature and the passionate conviction -- in that clip. For all the devotion and plaudits AOC draws on the left, she pulls in just as much derision and anger on the right. Of Ocasio-Cortez's speech on Tuesday night, the conservative New York Post headlined their story \" Ocasio-Cortez flips out after congressman calls Green New Deal 'elitist' .\" Fox News' writeup of the back and forth was titled \" AOC bristles as GOP lawmaker blasts Green New Deal as 'elitist' pet project of rich liberals .\" Politicians who generate passion -- among their supporters, yes, but also among their opponents -- are a very rare breed. And usually the ones who make the most noise in national politics. Ocasio-Cortez isn't yet 30 years old but she's already achieved that status.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/user/CNN?sub_confirmation=1", "https://bulletin.cnn.io", "https://nypost.com/2019/03/27/ocasio-cortez-flips-out-after-congressman-calls-green-new-deal-elitist/", "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ocasio-cortez-forced-to-defend-green-new-deal-after-gop-congressman-says-its-elitist-favored-by-rich-liberals", "https://twitter.com/AOC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "https://twitter.com/briantylercohen/status/1110700996282343424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://t.co/ESP4dC5TTo", "https://twitter.com/briantylercohen/status/1110700996282343424", "https://www.theringer.com/binge-mode"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alexandria ocasio-cortez", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "chris cillizza", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sean duffy", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "financial services committee", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wisconsin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-03-27T16:39:39.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "41c3bdc4eb10d5dcebd1d3f61ac89cbd0daa98f6", "url": "http://us.cnn.com/2019/03/27/politics/trade-deficit-china/index.html", "site_full": "us.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://us.cnn.com/us", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "US News \u2013 Top national stories and latest headlines - CNN", "title": "US trade deficit falls 15% as Americans buy less from China - CNNPolitics", "title_full": "US trade deficit falls 15% as Americans buy less from China - CNNPolitics", "published": "2019-03-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181114065945-01-china-shipping-container-file-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "41c3bdc4eb10d5dcebd1d3f61ac89cbd0daa98f6", "url": "http://us.cnn.com/2019/03/27/politics/trade-deficit-china/index.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Katie Lobosco", "published": "2019-03-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "US trade deficit falls 15% as Americans buy less from China - CNNPolitics", "text": "Washington (CNN) The monthly US trade deficit fell by nearly 15% in January, thanks largely to a shift with China as the two countries continue to negotiate a new trade agreement.\nThe US trade deficit in goods and services fell to $51.1 billion, down $8.8 billion compared to December, the Census Bureau reported Wednesday. The gap also narrowed compared to the year before. It decreased by $1.9 billion, or 3.7%, from January 2018. Most of the increase can be explained by a 14% drop in the trade deficit in China, America's largest trading partner. In part, that's due to US importers pulling back after rushing to buy Chinese goods ahead of possible tariff increases. President Donald Trump had threatened to raise the duty rate in March, but it never materialized. Soybean farmers are still paying for Trump's trade war The January data also shows a rise in soybean purchases from China. Beijing had stopped buying soybeans from American farmers last year in retaliation to Trump's tariffs. But the Chinese bought $1.2 billion of soybeans in January, up from just $299 million during the previous month, the Census report said. Read More The US trade deficit is pulling back from the widest level seen in a decade. It hit a record high in December and has grown by more than $100 billion since Trump took office. Trump says China tariffs may stay for 'a substantial period of time' The President has made it a priority to shrink the trade deficit, which he uses as a measure of whether the United States is winning or losing on trade. He's argued that bad trade deals have allowed other countries to take advantage of the United States. Last year, he imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods. The duties were meant to pressure Beijing to come to the negotiating table by encouraging Americans to buy less from China. But there are other factors that affect the country's trade deficit besides tariffs. Last year's federal tax cuts have put more money back into Americans' pockets, lifting demand for imports even if they're more expensive. Meanwhile, slowing global growth and a strong dollar could be a drag on exports.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/Press-Release/current_press_release/ft900.pdf"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "census bureau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-03-27T16:39:58.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6fa9d532e943863ed6f32067987ddb066cfafdd6", "url": "http://us.cnn.com/2019/03/27/politics/joe-biden-anita-hill-2020/index.html", "site_full": "us.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://us.cnn.com/us", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "US News \u2013 Top national stories and latest headlines - CNN", "title": "Joe Biden just revealed his biggest 2020 weakness - CNNPolitics", "title_full": "Joe Biden just revealed his biggest 2020 weakness - CNNPolitics", "published": "2019-03-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190321190245-20-week-in-photos-0322-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6fa9d532e943863ed6f32067987ddb066cfafdd6", "url": "http://us.cnn.com/2019/03/27/politics/joe-biden-anita-hill-2020/index.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Analysis by Chris Cillizza", "published": "2019-03-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Joe Biden just revealed his biggest 2020 weakness - CNNPolitics", "text": "(CNN) On Tuesday in New York, Joe Biden talked openly about the regret and frustration he feels for the way in which the 1991 Supreme Court confirmation of Clarence Thomas -- which the then Delaware senator oversaw as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee -- played out.\nTHE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE!\nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\nSpeaking about Anita Hill, a former co-worker of Thomas' who alleged that he had harassed her, Biden said this : \"We knew a lot less about the extent of harassment back then, over 30 years ago. She paid a terrible price, she was abused for the hearing. She was taken advantage of. Her reputation was attacked. I wish I could have done something. To this day I regret I couldn't come up with a way to get her the kind of hearing she deserved, given the courage she showed by reaching out to us.\" Biden's comments were part of a broader condemnation of what he called a \"white man's culture\" that has dominated in society -- and the Senate -- and that Biden believes has \"got to change.\" (He added that he did ultimately vote against Thomas' confirmation.) Which is a good sentiment! And the right sentiment for a candidate who very soon will be running for the Democratic presidential nomination. The problem for Biden -- and the Hill testimony makes it plainly -- is that he came of age in a very different political time, when \"white man's culture\" was totally and completely dominant. And, even more problematically for Biden, he has decades upon decades of recorded Senate votes that, if properly utilized by one of his Democratic opponents (or several of them) could cast him as someone who simply is not made for these times. Read More One of the most remarkable facts about Biden's life is that while he has run for president twice, in neither race has his long voting record in the Senate been given the sort of deep dive that we now come to expect of someone running for president. Biden's 1988 bid was cut short by plagiarism allegations that drove him out of the contest in 1987. In his 2008 run for president, he was never a top-tier (or, really, even second-tier) candidate, and so his opponents largely ignored him and the media didn't spend a ton of time looking into his l ng voting record. (Biden was first elected to the Senate in 1972.) That's not to say that Biden's Senate record doesn't have moments that distinguished him then -- and will distinguish him in the race to come. Biden's boast that he has \"the most progressive record\" of anyone in the 2020 field, which he is not yet in, might be a bit of a stretch, but there's no doubt that he played central roles in passing the Brady guns bill and the Violence Against Women Act . But the broader issue is that Biden has been around politics so long -- and voting in the Senate for so long -- that lots and lots of those votes can and will be picked apart as evidence that he is simply not the right person to lead an increasingly diverse, younger and more female Democratic Party. His stewardship over the Thomas hearing and his vote in favor of the 1994 crime bill are the two most obvious examples of that problem, but there are and will be others. In some ways, Biden is simply a product of his times. As he acknowledged on Tuesday in regard to Anita Hill, \"we knew a lot less about the extent of harassment back then, over 30 years ago.\" True! But this presidential race is being run in 2020, not 1990. And none of Biden's soon-to-be-opponents will let him off the hook for things he said and votes he made decades ago that might have reflected those times but seem deeply out of touch today. The danger for Biden in this race is clear: He runs the risk of coming off like Don Draper in a Peggy Olson world.

Democrats were also wary of getting stuck in a political trap Republicans made clear they were laying for them: GOP leaders were trying to lure Democrats to embrace a plan Republicans believe is outside of the mainstream, and then use it against them on the campaign trail. \"The Green New Deal is chockful of utopian ideas but completely devoid of concrete plans to implement any of its overreaching policies,\" said Sen. John Cornyn, a Republican from Texas, who complained it is a \"radical environmental policy\" that includes \"Medicare for all, free college, and guaranteed jobs.\" Read More \"You might as well throw in free beer and pizza,\" Cornyn added. Sen. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat who voted \"no\" Tuesday, said that he wanted to focus on \"real solutions that recognized the role fossil fuels will continue to play.\" \"We cannot successfully address our climate challenge by eliminating sources of energy that countries are committed to using,\" Manchin said in a statement. \"Only through innovating and developing new technologies that reduce carbon emissions will we truly make a difference.\" McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, has been upfront for weeks about his intentions in forcing the vote. He wanted to put Democrats, especially those running for president, on-the-record about their support for the high-profile and controversial plan, which was authored by two progressive Democrats, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts. Their plan seeks to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, secure clean air water, and a sustainable environment, create millions of high-wage jobs, switch the country's power demands so that 100% comes renewable sources, mitigate the health effects of pollution and climate change, among other goals. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, accused McConnell of playing \"gotcha politics.\" \"Republicans want to force this political stunt to distract from the fact that they neither have a plan nor a sense of urgency to deal with the threat of climate change,\" Schumer said. \"Everyone knows it's a stunt, including the majority leader himself. He put something on the floor and then votes no. What's the point of that?\" Besides the political vitriol on the floor from party leaders, there was some serious debate through the day from rank-and-file senators in both parties about climate change and the risks and rewards of doing something about it. Sen. Pat Roberts, a Republican of Kansas who chairs the Agriculture Committee, said that just as supporters of the Green New Deal believe they have moral imperative of protecting the planet, members of the agriculture industry -- who he argued already are conservation-minded -- believe they have a moral imperative to feed a hungry country and world. \"I think all Republicans understand there is climate change. All Republicans know that human activity does contribute to it,\" he said. \"Yes, we ought to do something. The point I'm trying to make here is that we don't want to do the wrong thing and cause a great deal of disruption in the process.\" Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a Republican of Alaska who chairs the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said climate change is felt in her state and bipartisan solutions that can be enduring are needed. \"It is important for us around here to make sure that we don't distract from those pragmatic, practical solutions. That we don't amp the rhetoric up so high that we can't get ourselves to a place where we can work cooperatively, collaboratively, to get to these solutions,\" she said. Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington, the top Democrat on the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, argued that changing to cleaner technologies will be better for the US economy over the long haul even if the transition to them could be challenging. \"We can transition to cleaner fuels, we can become more energy independent, we can become more energy efficient, and doing so actually creates new jobs that are higher-waged and help us in the future,\" she said. \"What Americans want to know is whether we can make it through this transition without doing great damage to our economy.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mitch mcconnell", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "green new deal", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "gop", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-03-27T16:40:15.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "66aff030dcb5769c78e7013bfbd7e08ad390e053", "url": "http://us.cnn.com/2019/03/27/politics/kirsten-gillibrand-2020-tax-returns-cnntv/index.html", "site_full": "us.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://us.cnn.com/us", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "US News \u2013 Top national stories and latest headlines - CNN", "title": "Kirsten Gillibrand releases tax returns, challenges other 2020 Democratic candidates to do the same - CNNPolitics", "title_full": "Kirsten Gillibrand releases tax returns, challenges other 2020 Democratic candidates to do the same - CNNPolitics", "published": "2019-03-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.006, "main_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190325142540-22-kristen-gillibrand-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "66aff030dcb5769c78e7013bfbd7e08ad390e053", "url": "http://us.cnn.com/2019/03/27/politics/kirsten-gillibrand-2020-tax-returns-cnntv/index.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Veronica Stracqualursi", "published": "2019-03-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Kirsten Gillibrand releases tax returns, challenges other 2020 Democratic candidates to do the same - CNNPolitics", "text": "Washington (CNN) Sen.

In 2016, Trump broke with decades of tradition and refused to release his tax returns, claiming he was under Internal Revenue Service audit. Trump's decision to forgo releasing his tax returns has incensed Democrats and ethics watchdogs, who accuse the President of hiding his assets that could indicate conflicts of interest. \"And now, as we fight to defeat Donald Trump, we need honesty, transparency and accountability more than ever. That's why Kirsten has posted her tax returns from the last 12 years here for all to see. And she's calling on every candidate in the Democratic field to follow her lead and release theirs, too,\" her campaign website reads, along with links to her past tax returns dating back to 2007. Read More Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has publicly released the past 10 years of her tax returns and has also called on \"every other candidate for President to do exactly the same thing\" in a tweet and online petition. She has not yet released her 2018 tax return, though the tax season ends on April 15. Democrats are starting to get antsy about the push for Trump's tax returns Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders recently promised to release 10 years of his tax returns, but he has not provide a timeline of when he'd do so. \"Soon,\" he told CNN's Wolf Blitzer during a CNN town hall last month . Asked what the delay was, Sanders said, \"It just was a mechanical issue. We don't have accountants at home. My wife does most of it and we will get that stuff out.\" Tax returns provide a fuller picture of a presidential candidate's financial state including sources of income, the candidates' tax rate, any charitable donations or foreign accounts. Prior to Trump, every president since Richard Nixon had released their tax returns, with the exception of Gerald Ford, who instead shared a decade's worth of summary data about his federal taxes. Some major party candidates have released decades' worth of returns, while others have only made the top two pages of their federal Form 1040 public. The Democratic-led House recently passed a sweeping legislative proposal that mandates the disclosure of presidential tax returns.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kirsten gillibrand", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "alisyn camerota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gillibrand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "internal revenue service", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-03-27T16:40:21.030+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a2977d74cedafba3a774fc7b600430671dffb255", "url": "http://us.cnn.com/2019/03/27/politics/obamacare-affordable-care-act-trump/index.html", "site_full": "us.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://us.cnn.com/us", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "US News \u2013 Top national stories and latest headlines - CNN", "title": "Getting rid of Obamacare would be a headache for Trump - CNNPolitics", "title_full": "Getting rid of Obamacare would be a headache for Trump - CNNPolitics", "published": "2019-03-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.008, "main_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180705120437-obamacare-insurers-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a2977d74cedafba3a774fc7b600430671dffb255", "url": "http://us.cnn.com/2019/03/27/politics/obamacare-affordable-care-act-trump/index.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Analysis by Zachary B.

Republicans can't find the votes to repeal or replace it. Democrats can't agree on how to make it better. President Donald Trump just wants to move on from it. But it's so ingrained at this point that if the courts suddenly end it, it could completely disrupt the US health insurance system -- and not just for people who buy insurance on the exchanges created by the law.\nIf you have health insurance or you at some point would like to have health insurance, what happens to Obamacare will affect you. The passage , the Supreme Court decision , the implementation and the attempted repeal of the law that remade the American health care system have each been separate dramas over the past nine years. Now begins Chapter 5: The second court drama. The Trump administration's about-face endorsement of a federal judge's December decision in Texas that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional could create an untenable situation since, essentially, all Americans with health insurance have Obamacare now. Here's what happens if the courts kill Obamacare Invalidating the entire law could strip coverage from tens of millions of Americans and strip protections for coverage enjoyed by hundreds of millions more. CNN's Tami Luhby has documented exactly how the law touches every American -- not just the more than 20 million who have obtained Medicaid or insurance through a state or federal health insurance exchange. Read More The fact is that exactly nine years after its passage, the Affordable Care Act, sometimes referred to as \"Obamacare,\" has remade the US health insurance system. No sign of a White House plan Despite Trump's tweet Tuesday that the GOP will become \"the Party of Healthcare!\", his pledge to take care of people with pre-existing conditions, and his complaint Wednesday that health care coverage is too expensive, it is increasingly, glaringly, alarmingly clear that the White House has no plan for what comes next if courts ultimately agree that the Affordable Care Act is now unconstitutional. The Republican Party will become \"The Party of Healthcare!\"\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 26, 2019 \"The Department of Justice is part of the executive branch, and the President has faith in his Department of Justice to do the right thing,\" senior adviser Kellyanne Conway told reporters Tuesday. \"And we're watching litigation. We don't predict the outcomes of litigation like that. We'll see what happens.\" It's a law that touches every American and gives millions of people coverage -- and we'll see what happens? There's a good chance the Supreme Court will ultimately weigh in, a process that could take years. But the new harder stance from Trump's Justice Department gave the case renewed and immediate interest. \"I'm flabbergasted,\" John Kasich said Tuesday after the court filing. He's a Republican former Ohio governor who has emerged as a frequent Trump critic and is now a CNN contributor. As governor, he took federal money for Ohio to expand Medicaid under the law even though he has long pointed to its problems. But Kasich said the country has to address the problems, not cut out the old law. He's pushed a proposal hashed out with a bipartisan group of governors . \"These things can all be fixed, but you don't need to just rip coverage away from 20 million people,\" he said. \"That's ridiculous.\" How to undo something that's part of society The main trunks of the law are a massive expansion of Medicaid and a total re-creation of the individual insurance market, but it mandated new protections in the group insurance market, forcing insurers to cover Americans with pre-existing conditions and allowing insured people to keep covering their adult children up to age 26. It also rewrote rules for Medicare, for hospitals and for prescription drug coverage. \"People have forgotten what it was like before the Affordable Care Act,\" said Gary Cohen, the vice president of government affairs for Blue Shield of California, one of the country's largest insurers. Before that he worked in the Obama administration and helped implement the Affordable Care Act. \"Not only if you were sick, but if you had ever been sick, you were priced out\" and charged differently than other individuals, Cohen said. To Trump's point that health care still seems too expensive, Cohen agreed that prices are too high, but he argued they would be higher without the Affordable Care Act. \"I'm sure that people aren't focused on what the trend in health care was before and after, but there's a lot of research that the prices have moderated,\" he said. While the administration now supports invalidating the entire law through the courts, how the Affordable Care Act would be undone is causing experts to scratch their heads. \"The Affordable Care Act is now so woven into the rest of the health care system that trying to take it out could upset things that were not even related,\" Julie Rovner of Kaiser Health News said Tuesday on CNN. States have spent years modifying their Medicaid programs around the Affordable Care Act, for instance. That process continues as the states that have not accepted Obamacare funding to expand Medicaid with federal dollars slowly move in that direction now that the government is allowing them waivers from certain requirements or to impose new rules that people work before qualifying to receive Medicaid. \"You think about how long the bill was and how many regulations have been put in place around the law over that nine-year period. It affected every source of how people get health care,\" said Sara Collins, a vice president at the Commonwealth Fund, which researches health care issues and pushes for improvements to the health care system.\" \"I cannot overstate how disruptive this would be,\" she said. Trump's quest to end the Affordable Care Act Trump's efforts along with Republicans on Capitol Hill to repeal the law failed in 2017, but his administration's attempts to chip away at it have continued, most importantly when they used a new tax law to lower the tax assessed for not having health insurance to $0. It is the lowering of the penalty that kicked off this latest drama. The judge in Texas agreed with a group of Republican state attorneys general that a $0 tax isn't a tax and so Chief Justice John Roberts' tortured decision upholding the Affordable Care Act was thrown into jeopardy. That's a turn of events worthy of a mystery novel. What will happen to Obamacare next!? That John Roberts, who -- thanks to a new book by CNN's Joan Biskupic -- we know vacillated on how to deal with the law the first time around, might now be invested in it. Opponents of the law said the possibility of it being undone should be a wake-up call to Congress to fix it. \"The DOJ's announcement is yet another data point that Congress needs to pass legislation that helps, not harms, Americans' ability to achieve their goals of lower health care costs, better choices, and access to care when they are sick,\" said Marie Fishpaw of the conservative Heritage Foundation, who endorses a plan that would give more power to states . American voters respond to health care Democrats paid a political price for passing the Affordable Care Act, losing control of the House of Representatives in a wave of backlash and conservative anger. Then Republicans paid a political price for coming so close to repealing it, losing control of the House last fall, and 41% of voters said in exit polls that the most important issue facing the country was health care. Democrats bombarded swing districts with ads about health care and warnings about the threat of losing insurance market protections like the ban on insurance companies excluding people with pre-existing conditions. At the same time, 69% of voters in 2016 said the health care system needs major changes. Those sentiments have given Democratic presidential candidates new energy to push the health care system further left, with new proposals for a public health insurance option or even a socialized health care system where the government takes over the insurance market. That debate was temporarily sidelined Tuesday as Democrats rallied around protecting the Affordable Care Act. More recently, American voters say by 55% to 32% that they'd rather improve the current health care system than replace it, according to a new Quinnipiac survey . Those results were published in the context of the debate pushed by Democrats about whether to move toward a single-payer health insurance system, but they're interesting in terms of the possibility the Trump administration could go in the other direction and have the entire Affordable Care Act invalidated. The number of Americans with favorable views of the law itself has grown and hovered around 50% in recent years, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, as the percentage of Americans with unfavorable views has fallen below 40%. Red states moving toward Medicaid The effort to undo the law in the courts continues even as more red states find ways to expand Medicaid under it. Kasich was among the first Republican governors to buy into the almost entirely federally funded expansion of Medicaid, and he has defended that decision ever since. But even more conservative governors are following suit, especially now that the federal government is agreeing to special waivers from rules for accepting the money, like requiring the insured to work. Holdout states tiptoe toward Medicaid expansion under Obamacare There were developments in Georgia this week , for instance, where the GOP-controlled Legislature gave new power to the Republican governor. Fourteen states have rejected the expansion of Medicaid envisioned by the Affordable Care Act. They're mainly in the South, although Wisconsin is also represented. Every one of them supported Trump in 2016. But 16 states that supported him have expanded Medicaid. In all, 4.9 million people who would otherwise be eligible for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act aren't currently. Some of those qualify for help to buy private insurance, but more than 2.5 million are caught in a technicality of the law: They make too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to qualify for help to buy private insurance. Nearly half of these in the so-called coverage gap are spread across Texas and Florida, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation . Even as red states come around and take Medicaid funds, it doesn't mean the Republicans who run those states will be supporting the law anytime soon, but it could make it so much more difficult for so many more people if the courts suddenly take it away.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2609", "https://www.colorado.gov/governor/sites/default/files/bipartisan_governors_blueprint_022218final.pdf", "https://www.heritage.org/health-care-reform/commentary/heres-the-path-forward-health-reform-2018", "https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/georgia-lawmakers-approve-kemp-plan-for-medicaid-obamacare-waivers/bsIyA06ffChr8OjGn0bGmK/", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1110586787808903168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/the-coverage-gap-uninsured-poor-adults-in-states-that-do-not-expand-medicaid/", "https://www.heritage.org/staff/marie-fishpaw"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "obamacare", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-03-27T16:40:59.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "03f4cdc10faaba1ded9703fe346d98a03af8c9c2", "url": "http://us.cnn.com/2019/03/27/politics/john-roberts-sober-puss-the-chief/index.html", "site_full": "us.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://us.cnn.com/us", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "US News \u2013 Top national stories and latest headlines - CNN", "title": "'The Chief': John Roberts' journey from 'sober puss' to the pinnacle of American law - CNNPolitics", "title_full": "'The Chief': John Roberts' journey from 'sober puss' to the pinnacle of American law - CNNPolitics", "published": "2019-03-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.875, "main_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190320122055-20190320-john-roberts-portrait-biskupic-book-politics-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "03f4cdc10faaba1ded9703fe346d98a03af8c9c2", "url": "http://us.cnn.com/2019/03/27/politics/john-roberts-sober-puss-the-chief/index.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Joan Biskupic", "published": "2019-03-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "'The Chief': John Roberts' journey from 'sober puss' to the pinnacle of American law - CNNPolitics", "text": "Washington (CNN) Adapted from \" The Chief: The Life and Turbulent Times of Chief Justice John Roberts \" by Joan Biskupic. Copyright \u00a9 2019. Available from Basic Books.\nChief Justice John Roberts has always had perfect timing. Shortly before he reached high school age, an elite boarding school was founded near his northern Indiana home. Even as a young boy he knew that it offered a place to obtain a superior education and \"stay ahead of the crowd,\" as he wrote. Roberts graduated from Harvard Law School as his brand of conservatism was in ascendance nationally. He joined the Reagan administration and with likeminded attorneys began trying to roll back liberal-era policies. \"This is an exciting time,\" he wrote to a mentor, \" ... when so much that has been taken for granted for so long is being seriously reconsidered.\" In 2005, when he was just 50, he was nominated to succeed retiring Supreme Court Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. But before confirmation hearings could be held, Chief Justice William Rehnquist died. A confluence of events -- including public outrage over the administration's response to Hurricane Katrina -- prompted President George W. Bush to switch Roberts' nomination to the Rehnquist vacancy in search of an easy political win. Read More Roberts became the youngest chief justice in more than 200 years, and from the start he has enjoyed a conservative majority on the nine-member bench. The 2016 death of Justice Antonin Scalia and the possibility of a liberal appointment by then-President Barack Obama or a President Hillary Clinton might have deprived Roberts of that majority. But after the Senate stalled on Obama nominee Merrick Garland for nearly a year and Donald Trump became President, Roberts' hand was, in fact, strengthened. Trump appointees Neil Gorsuch, in 2017, and Brett Kavanaugh, in 2018, have put Roberts in charge of an even stronger five-justice conservative majority. The law in America will come down to what Roberts says it is. The question is what this enigmatic figure who feels the weight of his position will do with his power. Roberts, now 64, could remake the bench more in his conservative image, or he may opt to be more of an institutionalist, especially with Trump in office. He has already called out Trump for the President's comments attacking judges. RELATED: Supreme Court conservatives question challenges of partisan gerrymandering Roberts also has signaled he may move cautiously. In February, he cast the fifth vote, siding with the four liberals, to block a restrictive Louisiana abortion regulation, at least temporarily. Roberts has long opposed abortion rights, but in this case, the disputed law was similar to a Texas regulation invalidated by the high court in 2016 (over a Roberts dissent), and it appeared a lower court was ignoring that ruling to uphold the Louisiana statute. The inside story of how John Roberts negotiated to save Obamacare Roberts does not appear to be ready to break the pattern of his life's work. He has staked out unflinchingly conservative positions in most areas of the law over the past 14 years. He wrote the Shelby County v. Holder decision that curtailed the reach of the Voting Rights Act and made it harder to prevent arguably discriminatory election procedures before they took effect. Roberts also was part of the bare five-justice majority that produced Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, lifting limits on corporate and union money in elections, and District of Columbia v. Heller, which broke ground on the Second Amendment and declared an individual right to bear arms. There is one major exception to his conservatism that has helped define Roberts in the public eye. In a 2012 dispute over the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, Roberts saved the Obama-sponsored health care overhaul from being struck down. That decision came only after the chief justice switched two key positions, angering conservatives and baffling liberals. RELATED: Unlike Mueller, health care will likely be a top issue in 2020 It was seen by some as an assertion of independence. His declaration against Trump last November showed another kind of independence. Speaking on behalf of the entire third branch of government, Roberts reinforced his long-standing message that the judiciary is above the politics of other two branches. \"We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges,\" Roberts said in a statement. It was a rebuke to Trump, who had criticized a judge who had ruled against the Trump administration as an \"Obama judge.\" 'Sober puss' to a 'call to action' As a child, Roberts was so serious and focused that an aunt said he was sometimes known -- fondly -- as \"sober puss.\" He racked up A's and became an academic star, shaped especially by La Lumiere, his all-male Catholic boarding school. Students took Latin all four years, along with calculus and other college-level work. Jacket and tie were required for class. When Roberts applied to La Lumiere in December 1968 at age 13, he wrote to the headmaster in impeccable cursive: \"I've always wanted to stay ahead of the crowd, and I feel that the competition at La Lumiere will force me to work as hard as I can. At an ordinary high school it would probably be easy to stay ahead. .... I won't be content to get a good job by getting a good education, I want to get the best job by getting the best education.\" Once enrolled, a classmate recalled, \"At 8 at night John would be studying. ... at 8 in the morning John would be studying.\" RELATED: Where John Roberts is unlikely to compromise Roberts graduated first in his class at La Lumiere and went to Harvard, where he majored in history. As he finished his studies in just three years, rather than the usual four, and went on to law school at Harvard, he was sometimes put off by the campus liberalism. But when he graduated in 1979, the country was on the cusp of a new conservatism. Roberts later described hearing a \"call to action\" from Republican President Ronald Reagan. \"I felt he was speaking directly to me.\" JUST WATCHED Chief Justice Roberts has a tough dilemma Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH\nChief Justice Roberts has a tough dilemma 02:43 'A gentle soul' In the Reagan and then George H.W. Bush administrations, Roberts developed views that became the scaffolding for his positions on the bench today. Especially on affirmative action, voting rights and other racial issues, a straight line can be drawn from his legal work in the 1980s and early 1990s to the center chair of the Supreme Court. Roberts was no mere follower of an agenda set by more senior administration officials. He embraced the conservatism of the day, was attuned to the administration's messaging in the press and sometimes wrote memos complaining to bosses of colleagues on the legal team who were not all in. Yet he was no firebrand in the public eye. Roberts, who carefully prepares for all appearances, has always sounded eminently reasonable, like the star advocate he was when he argued 39 cases before the high court. His confidence is manifest, but never brazen. Roberts became an appeals court judge in 2003, appointed by President George W. Bush, and two years later, was chosen for the Supreme Court. Bush brushed away advisers who suggested he choose an older, more experienced nominee. \"Beyond the sparkling resume was a genuine man with a gentle soul,\" Bush wrote in his 2010 memoir, \"Decision Points,\" of his impressions of Roberts. \"He had a quick smile and spoke with a passion about the two young children he and his wife, Jane, had adopted. His command of the law was obvious, as was his character.\" One of the top aides whom Bush turned to for advice during the 2005 selection process was his staff secretary, Brett Kavanaugh. Bush said Kavanaugh suggested as a tiebreaker: \"which man would be the most effective leader on the court -- the most capable of convincing his colleagues through persuasion and strategic thinking.\" In late August 2005, as Roberts was preparing for his Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearings, Hurricane Katrina slammed into New Orleans. The storm surge overwhelmed the city's levees and flooded many neighborhoods. The Bush administration bungled the federal response, delaying help for the region, where more than a thousand people died. In the middle of the Katrina catastrophe, Chief Justice Rehnquist died, on September 3. Bush had no appetite for more controversy, and having seen senators' initial glowing responses to Roberts, the President immediately moved the Roberts nomination to the Rehnquist seat. RELATED: The inside story of how John Roberts negotiated to save Obamacare JUST WATCHED Trump fires back after Chief Justice issues rare rebuke Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH\nTrump fires back after Chief Justice issues rare rebuke 04:04 The court's reputation may depend on Roberts From the beginning of his tenure, Roberts could count on four fellow conservatives for most of his positions. When Kennedy would shift to the liberal side, notably on social issues, Roberts often took a strong stand in opposition. The most conspicuous came in 2015, when he protested the majority's decision that declared same-sex marriage a constitutional right. For the first time ever, Roberts decided to read portions of his dissent from the courtroom bench. Justices take this dramatic step when they want to draw particular attention to their condemnation of a majority decision. In what is still Roberts' only such oral dissent, he complained that the majority was infringing on an issue that should be handled by elected legislators. \"Just who do we think we are?\" he asked rhetorically. \"This is a court, not a legislature. ... We have to say what the law is, not what it should be.\" Kennedy, who was the court's voice on gay rights and its swing vote on abortion and affirmative action, retired last July after 30 years on the bench. Where John Roberts is unlikely to compromise Roberts is now the member of the conservative bloc closest to the center. But he is unlikely to be a \"swing vote\" like Kennedy, whose flexible approach meant the four liberals could regularly attract his vote, especially on major social dilemmas. RELATED: Chief Justice John Roberts sides with liberals in death penalty case The reconstituted court will be tested in upcoming months on disputes already on its calendar involving religious rights and partisan gerrymandering, as well as petitions related to bias against gay men, lesbians and transgender people and related to abortion rights. Already on the schedule for the new term that will begin in October is a major Second Amendment test involving a New York law that restricts the transportation of firearms outside of the home. Roberts' new control presents a new dilemma in his effort to make the court seem above politics. The five conservative justices were all appointed by Republican presidents; the four liberals by Democrats. And they do appear, depending on their presidential benefactors, to be \"Bush judges\" and \"Trump judges,\" or, alternatively, \"Clinton judges\" and \"Obama judges.\" RELATED: Is Clarence Thomas headed out or just getting started?

Every day it kills us. Kill us in my school. Kill us in the wedding. Kill us in the park. Kill us in the garden. Kill us in the street. Everybody thinks the USA kills us.\" Abdel al Montasser believes the US backs Saudi Arabia for financial reasons. English literature professor Abdel al Montasser echoed the message of the Saudi cash-cow mural, saying that US leaders are \"thinking of their own benefits. Saudi Arabia and Gulf countries, they are rich. So the US wants to milk them -- like Trump\". It would have been impossible to hold such a rally until a ceasefire for the city was agreed at talks between the coalition, which backs the Yemeni government, and Houthi rebels in December last year. Bomb that killed 40 children in Yemen was supplied by the US The truce holds, just. At night neither side can resist an occasional exchange of fire. And the Houthis continue to restrict access to the city for humanitarian workers. They've also been accused of dragging their feet on allowing the United Nations to run the port, which is the lifeline to the outside world for the north of the country where 70 percent of Yemenis live. And of failing, as agreed, to hand over control of Hodeidah to the local police force. But in the Houthi-controlled areas the streets are busy -- crammed with cars that are forced to zigzag around earth mounds that block alternate lanes as a defensive measure against invaders. Shops are full of food and brightly colored plastic children's toys. Now that mobile phone networks have been repaired, the stores stocking them are doing a brisk trade. 'What gives them the right to bomb us?' Exhausted Yemenis demand halt to war But in al Thawra Hospital, the scenes are very different. It's close to the front line. Its entrance was bombed a few months ago. This is where the war is felt even if, in Hodeidah, the numbers of wounded have fallen dramatically. The staff know they could be a target -- other hospitals and clinics have been hit in air strikes. Intensive care head nurse Hoda Solliman explained why she keeps coming to work even though her family begs her not to. Hoda Solliman says hospital staff will stay with their patients, even if they are a target. \"If you see people who can't find medical care, then we have to rescue them, even if this hospital is under bombardment. When there were clashes, we remained here. When they attacked the hospital, we stayed here. If we don't relieve the suffering of this people, who will?\" she said. Most serious cases are transferred on a seven-hour drive to Sanaa, the country's capital that has been controlled by the Houthis since they rose against the government of Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi. But only if the patients can be moved. We're running out of time and money to help the children of Yemen Ayat lies inert in her bed. She cannot be moved. Weakened by malnutrition, she's been assaulted by a host of illnesses -- much like her country. Yemen is among the poorest of nations at the best of times. It's also riven by tribal and religious conflicts. The south, which is part of the alliance against the Houthis, is also fighting al Qaeda. Some radical Islamist Salafi groups are fighting alongside forces of the Hadi government, the Saudis and the UAE close to Hodeidah - and they're supported, for now, by the separatist Southern Transitional Council. The Houthis, who are Shia unlike Sunni Muslim southerners, are backed by Iran, which has sent advisers and helped to build sea and air drones. Ayat is only 10 years old. Her body is being ravaged by multiple illnesses. Caught in the middle are people like 10-year-old Ayat, whose frail body has been invaded by diseases that have attacked her liver and her kidneys -- while malaria rages in her brain. Next to her a smaller child is battling a meningitis infection that has already killed her brother. And next to her lies a girl of 14, face down on her bed, machines beeping all around her as tubes feed her air and fluids and drain her bladder. The World Food Programme says that 10 million Yemenis are \"one step away from famine.\" But they've shown remarkable resilience while Saudi Arabia and her allies have continued their proxy war with Iran. But for this one teenager, the future seemed to hold nothing but misery. Medics said that she comes from a destitute family and felt she was a burden. So she tried to hang herself.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "king sal", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "united arab emirates", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yemen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saudi arabia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-03-27T16:41:43.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "53ba03666c56000222a471ddd44888cfcf36b698", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/27/politics/barbara-bush-biography-book-republican-party-melania-trump-letter/index.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rss%2Fcnn_latest+%28RSS%3A+CNN+-+Most+Recent%29", "site_full": "edition.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_latest.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "USA Today: Barbara Bush no longer considered herself a Republican after Trump became President, book says - CNNPolitics", "title_full": "USA Today: Barbara Bush no longer considered herself a Republican after Trump became President, book says - CNNPolitics", "published": "2019-03-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180417112532-barbara-bush-endorsing-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 16476, "comments": 4235, "shares": 3963}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c9e97737c7258a00610c9702fe0ee5b46ab19c4c", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/27/politics/barbara-bush-biography-book-republican-party-melania-trump-letter/index.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Veronica Stracqualursi", "published": "2019-03-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "USA Today: Barbara Bush no longer considered herself a Republican after Trump became President, book says - CNNPolitics", "text": "For more on the Bush family legacy, watch CNN's Original Series \"The Bush Years,\" Sundays at 10pm ET. Washington (CNN) Former first lady Barbara Bush didn't consider herself a Republican after Donald Trump took office, according to a forthcoming book obtained by USA Today about the matriarch of a GOP political dynasty.\n\"After Trump's rise, she saw it as a party she could not continue to support, a party she no longer recognized -- even as one of her grandsons, George P. Bush, was on the ballot as a Republican running for re-election as Texas land commissioner,\" author Susan Page wrote in an excerpt adapted from her new book, \"The Matriarch: Barbara Bush and the Making of an American Dynasty.\" The excerpt was published Wednesday in USA Today . Future of the Bush dynasty: Service? Yes. White House? Maybe Bush had answered \"yes\" when asked in October 2017 whether she was a Republican, according to Page, who interviewed the former first lady in the final months of her life before she died last April . When asked the same question by Page four months later, when Trump was in office, Bush replied: \"I'd probably say no today.\" Photos: The life of former first lady Barbara Bush Photos: The life of former first lady Barbara Bush Former first lady Barbara Bush , the matriarch of a Republican political dynasty and a first lady who elevated the cause of literacy, died April 17, 2018, at age 92.

Guo, a sociology professor at the same university, said Xu's work as a teacher, researcher and tutor had been suspended. She said the details of Xu's suspension were still unclear but it had been in a major part due to an essay he published in July 2018. The lengthy article, titled \"Imminent Fears, Immediate Hopes,\" challenged the direction of China under Xi and called for the reintroduction of presidential term limits, which were controversially removed by the government in early 2018. \"Suddenly, as if out of nowhere, we had a 'supreme leader' with no checks on his power; how could people not have all kinds of strange imaginings and new fears?\" Xu asked in his essay. Read More China's Xi Jinping begins his most important year at his weakest point The investigation into Xu is just the latest action taken by the Chinese government to repress dissenting voices or opinions that run contrary to the ruling Communist Party's policies. It also shows no voices challenging Xi will be tolerated as he continues to consolidate his position as China's most powerful ruler since Chairman Mao Zedong. Speaking to the New York Times by text earlier in the week, Xu said he didn't know what would happen to him next. \"I've been mentally preparing for this for a long time. At the worst, I could end up in prison,\" he told the newspaper. Fellow teacher Guo said it wasn't clear why authorities had waited so long to take action after the essay was published. She said if one person was banned from speaking, it was a problem for everyone. \"As for myself, I speak not because I'm brave, it's because I'm frightened. And I'm worried this may happen to anyone else,\" she said. Freedom of speech? The move is especially shocking given the prestigious reputation of Tsinghua University, which is over 100 years old and has been consistently rated as one of the world's best schools. The most recent Times Higher Education World University Rankings placed Tsinghua as the top institution in Asia and 22nd overall. The report attributed Tsinghua's high global ranking to \"improvements to its teaching environment, in particular increases in institutional income and the share of PhD degrees awarded.\" Beijing's equally famous Peking University, ranked 31 on the same Times report, has also been subject to a crackdown in the past few months, targeting the school's Marxist student leaders who had been working to promote workers' rights across China. Chinese Marxist students appear in 'confession' video as crackdown continues A number of Peking University student activists have been taken into custody by authorities since August, some of whom haven't been seen since. Presciently, Xu criticized the repression and intolerance for academics under Xi's increasingly oppressive regime in his essay, saying it would hamper free discussion among Chinese intellectuals. \"In an atmosphere such as this, how can there be any freedom of speech? Without intellectual freedom and the independent spirit, what hope is there for people to explore the unknown, for the advancement of scholarship or for intellectual creativity,\" he said.

But Brundish has a set of statistics he believes sufficiently ends any debate on the matter. \"Currently Messi has a goal or assist every 48 minutes,\" Brundish says. \"Bearing in mind that every game is almost 95 minutes long (when injury time is included) that's two almost every single game.\" Few can come close to these feats -- although Cristiano Ronaldo has long had a comparable, and sometimes superior, goal scoring rate. More recently, the likes of Luis Suarez, Neymar, Kylian Mbappe and Mohamed Salah have also all excelled in scoring for their respective club and national teams. Yet Brundish says the real supremacy of Messi lies not only in his goalscoring feats but also how highly he rates in a statistic known as xG-Build. Read More Lionel Messi on the field for Futbol Club Barcelona. Read: Rival fans chant Messi's name after hat-trick This metric awards points to every player involved in a goal except from the person who supplied the final pass (assist) and the goalscorer. For example, if a goalkeeper started a move by passing to a defender, who then played the ball to winger before squaring for a striker to score, the goalkeeper and defender would score statistical points under the xG-Build system. Given Messi's prodigious goal and assist rate, it would seem logical that his xG-build score would lag behind other players who have more of a role in the early stage build up to a goal given the spaces they usually occupy on the field. But Brundish says that's not the case. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features and videos Using 2017-18 full-season data from football statistics website, Understat, Messi scores considerably higher in xG-build than some of the world's most potent playmakers, including Chelsea's Eden Hazard , Arsenal's Mesut Ozil and Tottenham's Christian Eriksen .

In response, Deputy Prime Minister Wissanu Krue-ngam called the anti-junta coalition a \"merely psychological strategy that will not bear fruit.\" Read More The outcome of Sunday's election is still unclear, with no party taking a decisive lead but both leading parties -- Pheu Thai and the pro-military Palang Pracharat -- claiming the right to form a coalition. Persistent delays in the release of the final results have fueled confusion. Thai election 'not free and fair' says monitor group Representatives of the pro-democracy coalition told reporters that together they could muster 255 seats based on preliminary results. \"We have obtained the majority and received consensus from the people,\" said Sudarat. In the lower house, 350 seats will be filled with winners in the various constituencies and the remaining 150 through a party list proportional system. Parties are still waiting to hear how many seats they will be allocated under the proportional system, which could be decisive in reaching a majority. Pheu Thai had 137 constituency seats according to the latest count on Monday. Palang Pracharat -- which wants junta leader Prayut to return to power -- had 97 seats, according to the Election Commission. Official final results will not be announced until May 9. Pheu Thai is the party of populist former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, toppled by a coup in 2006, and of his sister Yingluck. She also become prime minister but was impeached just before the military coup in 2014. Thaksin and leaders connected to him have won every election since 2001. Thailand's youth demand change ahead of elections Palang Pracharat is also intent on forming a coalition government on the basis that it is leading the popular vote despite lagging in the number of constituency seats according to Monday's tally. The party also has the backing of the 250-member Senate or upper house, whose members are all appointed by the military. Future Forward, which shot up in the polls after winning support from the younger generation and looks set to become the third largest party, joined the pro-democracy alliance on Wednesday. Its leader Thanathorn Jungrungruangkit demanded that the Election Commission release the returns from each polling station so the figures could be scrutinized. There are mounting concerns over irregularities in Sunday's poll, including nearly 2 million votes that were disqualified as \"bad ballots.\" On Tuesday election watchdog Open Forum for Democracy Foundation said the poll was \"not free and fair\" while another group, The Asian Network for Free Elections, said the process \"displays fundamental democratic shortcomings.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "wissanu krue-ngam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sudarat keyuraphan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "bangkok", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thailand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palang pracharat", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-03-27T16:43:52.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c112be34dad325768b460b0ab9a02b859e5efb6d", "url": "http://us.cnn.com/2019/03/27/europe/china-europe-brexit-italy-bri-intl-gbr/index.html", "site_full": "us.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://us.cnn.com/world", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "World news \u2013 breaking news, videos and headlines - CNN", "title": "China is the big winner from Europe's Brexit chaos", "title_full": "China is the big winner from Europe's Brexit chaos - CNN", "published": "2019-03-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.997, "main_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190327123555-china-italy-xi-jinping-0323-01-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c112be34dad325768b460b0ab9a02b859e5efb6d", "url": "http://us.cnn.com/2019/03/27/europe/china-europe-brexit-italy-bri-intl-gbr/index.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Analysis by James Griffiths", "published": "2019-03-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "China is the big winner from Europe's Brexit chaos", "text": "(CNN) European Union leaders sat down last week for what was supposed to be a summit meeting to discuss China, perhaps the biggest external economic and diplomatic challenge currently facing the EU.\nInstead, they ended up talking about Brexit, again. That UK lawmakers have spent the last 33 months since the country voted to leave the EU failing to agree on how to do so has thrown multiple spanners into the complicated workings of the bloc, whose leaders desperately need to hash out unified policies on a number of issues, but are instead constantly derailed by the one member state who, at least in theory, doesn't want to be there. Next month, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang will visit Brussels for a summit with European leaders, before heading for Croatia for a meeting with representatives of a organization of 16 central and eastern European countries, just the kind of grouping some fear could be used to split the wider EU. Ahead of last week's summit meeting, the European Commission said that China \"is simultaneously a cooperation partner with whom the EU has closely aligned objectives, a negotiating partner, with whom the EU needs to find a balance of interests, an economic competitor in pursuit of technological leadership, and a systemic rival promoting alternative models of governance.\" Read More China is the EU's largest trading partner, while Europe is China's second largest after the US, with over $1 billion in trade between the two parties done every day on average. Crafting a unified policy on how to interact with Beijing is a key issue for Brussels, and one the EU can hardly afford to screw up. But there is considerable disagreement within the bloc on how to go about finding this balance, with some members, notably Germany, increasingly hawkish with regard to Beijing, both as an economic and security challenge, while other countries remain eager to embrace Chinese investment. Italy and China That eagerness was on show in Rome this month, as Italian leaders rolled out the red carpet for Chinese President Xi Jinping , after becoming the largest European economy, and first G7 member, to sign up to his Belt and Road trade and infrastructure initiative. Italy's participation in Xi's project is not only an economic win for Beijing, but potentially creates a wedge for use against the wider EU on key issues in future, said Lucrezia Poggetti, a research associate at the Berlin-based Mercator Institute for China Studies (MERICS). \"China is very keen to deal with EU nations separately, rather than as a bloc,\" she said. \"In bilateral relations, China has the upper hand because of its huge economic power compared to individual European countries.\" She pointed to a move by Greece and Hungary -- both key allies of China's on the continent -- to water down criticism of Beijing over its behavior in the hotly disputed South China Sea, and Athens' intervention in 2017 to block an EU statement critical of China's human rights record. \"In both cases, Greece feared upsetting the Chinese government and potentially losing access to economic opportunities promised by Beijing, so it broke ranks with the EU instead,\" Poggetti said. \"Hungary has also been more openly close to China politically.\" At a meeting in Brussels this month, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Beijing \"firmly supports the European integration process, firmly supports the EU in staying united and becoming stronger, and firmly supports Europe in playing a more important role in international affairs.\" Italys Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte (right) and China's President Xi Jinping shake hands upon Xi Jinping's arrival for their meeting at Villa Madama in Rome on March 23, 2019 as part of a two-day visit to Italy. Chinese carrots While Beijing has historically stronger ties with some European countries (and weaker ones with those nations that once invaded and colonized it), a recent and evolving dynamic has seen EU members allying with China in intra-union squabbles. Writing this week , Bruno Macaes, a former Portuguese minister for Europe, warned that China was both being used as a weapon by European states seeking leverage against each other, and was exploiting divides old and new to its own ends. \"The problem is that the EU does not have the effective mechanisms to manage serious conflicts between member states, tempting EU nations to call upon external actors to challenge the status quo for them,\" he said. In particular, as hostility to the entire European project spreads, affecting not only the UK but also Italy, Hungary and other member states, the opportunities for China to find willing new partners are increasing. \"It's even easier for Beijing to drive a wedge between the EU and Eurosceptic governments,\" Poggetti said. \"The EU needs to prepare for pushback from Italy -- an influential member of the EU as a founder of the Union and third largest economy of the Eurozone -- on a common European China policy.\" Brexit is perhaps the ultimate Euroskeptic wedge in this regard. Both European and British politicians have warned that a UK outside the EU could end up a rival to it, rather than an ally along the lines of Norway or Switzerland, and Chinese investment and trade will be a key area of competition. A successful Brexit-ed Britain, buoyed by new trade deals with China, could also embolden other EU states to go their own way. Jonathan Sullivan, an expert on China at the University of Nottingham, said the \"EU's power, such as it is, in international trade and foreign relations, is predicated on acting in unison.\" \"So if any country wants to make inroads in whatever sector in Europe, trying to promote disunity or 'pick member states off' and deal with them individually is a powerful strategy,\" he said. \"Beijing has had difficulties dealing with the EU in numerous sectors for a variety of reasons, and the incentive to try to weaken the EU's capacity to act in a concerted, unified way, is strong.\" JUST WATCHED Here's what you need to know about Brexit Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH\nHere's what you need to know about Brexit 03:05 External pressure Macaes and others have highlighted that Beijing is not the only major foreign power seeking to leverage European disunity. US President Donald Trump has also dangled economic and diplomatic carrots for European capitals willing to break with Brussels on areas of disagreement with Washington, such as the Iran nuclear deal . \"Trump has tried the method, bashing Germany over defense, dangling long-desired political prizes before Poland and the UK, and lavishing praise on the Italian coalition,\" Macaes said. \"Russia is a long-standing but exceedingly clumsy operator. China understands how to insert itself in these debates.\" Tackling this challenge will require something that has been strikingly lacking from European policy in recent years: Unity. But while external pressure has so far largely fostered greater division, analysts said it could also help drive the bloc together, as EU member states begin to see the costs of dealing with a player as powerful as China alone, and re-embrace the original purpose of bloc-wide policies. The outside pressure could also help spark long needed reform on just how those policies are made, enabling the EU to benefit all members equally. European leaders just need to sort out Brexit first. And the refugee crisis. And get through the European Parliament elections. And put in a plan for tackling the effects of climate change.

That same year, hundreds of children were expelled from schools for scribbling on the President's face in their books. Nkurunziza, who has been in office since 2005, was re-elected to a third term in 2015 despite massive protests and concerns over the legality of running beyond his second term.

They are authors of the forthcoming book \"You're It: Crisis, Change, and How to Lead When It Matters Most.\" commentary are their own.\nOne crucial thing that you don't get back in a crisis is time. After two crashes on its 737 Max 8 aircraft that killed everyone on board \u2014 just months apart \u2014 Boeing has lost a lot of time, and it can't afford to waste any more. For days, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg's most visible action was a reported call to President Trump to vouch for the plane's safety. This drove rampant speculation that he was trying to forestall government action, which he ultimately failed to do. And the company's lobbying activity and $1 million donation to Trump's inaugural committee certainly hasn't helped quell that speculation. If nothing else, the company and its executives look obsessed with their short-term business interests. It may be too late for Boeing to be the hero in this story, though it can counter its depiction as villain. Boeing must be more proactive than reactive if it hopes to recapture public trust and rebuild brand value. Its move to develop a software patch and support pilot training on the new systems are good steps, but there's more the company can do. Remember timing matters Boeing made serious timing missteps. It was not until March 18 \u2014 eight days after the Ethiopian Airlines crash \u2014 that Muilenburg embraced the emotional weight of the unfolding events in a video statement . It was excellent in its sentiment. However, it was late, coming five days after Southwest Airlines CEO Gary Kelly released a compassionate video. Boeing should have been first, not last, to the table.

Here's why it could create real impact\nAmerica is facing a leadership crisis. It's on us to fix it\nOf course, company lawyers worry about what the company and its executives say or do in the days following a crisis. They will have to deal with the inevitable litigation and investigations in which this all becomes evidence. However, in limiting itself to dry statements for several days, Boeing created an \"empathy gap\" where it appeared cold and uncaring rather than acknowledging the pain, uncertainty and concern felt by the loved ones of those who died in the two crashes. The most important steps to take now are to listen and thoughtfully respond. It is time for dialogue, not monologue. Listen to the families. Listen to the pilots. Boeing has invited pilots and regulators to briefings. Beyond that, it must respond with tangible actions that reflect the concerns of those stakeholders and help to prevent similar incidents in the future. Focus on the company's future reputation Reputation is a long-term consideration. Boeing's once unblemished reputation \u2014 which it spent years building \u2014 has been shattered. Passengers who may have given little attention to the make and model of an aircraft will now look much more closely, and each action Boeing takes today will affect how people view the company for years to come. As the leader of a company, you have to put the organization's mission and welfare above your self-interest. That's what you sign up for.\"\nLeonard J. Marcus and Eric J. McNulty\nThe best guide is former Johnson & Johnson CEO James Burke's response to the Tylenol poisonings in 1982. When three people died in the Chicago area after taking Tylenol, Burke shaped the company's future with a nationwide recall of the product. He went big and moved fast with the company's response, putting consumer confidence above short-term sales. Burke's efforts became an enduring exemplar of crisis response by a CEO. Muilenburg needs to focus on the future. He must emphasize transparency, humility and authenticity. He must demonstrate to every stakeholder that the company is \u2014 and will be \u2014 fully trustworthy. He must prove that nothing will keep him from making things right. That starts with more listening, this time to employees. We assume that no one at Boeing willfully put passenger safety at risk. Yet forces, perhaps competitive pressures, may have caused some to underestimate risk and overestimate the robustness of internal controls. The answers are inside the company, and Boeing's reputation will need to be rebuilt from the inside-out. The company must regain confidence in itself through relentless root cause analysis. If it hasn't done so already, it should gather all of its employees together and have a brutally honest conversation about how decisions were made that led to this outcome. Reverse engineer what will be Muilenburg should assign teams to rapidly work through two scenarios: Best case, it is 2025 and Boeing is the most trusted name in aviation. Worst case, it's 2025 and Boeing is out of business. The teams should then work backwards to March 2019 to trace the steps that led to each outcome. Facing such stark and divergent futures will illuminate strategic and tactical choices to be made today \u2014 and in the weeks and months ahead. It is better to stare into the abyss than to step into it blindly. Of course, if Boeing did not act in good faith in deploying the 737 Max and the Justice Department's investigation discovers Boeing cut corners or attempted to avoid proper regulatory reviews of the modifications to the aircraft, Muilenburg and any other executives involved should resign immediately. Too many families, indeed communities, depend on the continued viability of Boeing. As the leader of a company, you have to put the organization's mission and welfare above your self-interest.

The EU rules don't mandate specific technology for the systems, which can be temporarily overridden by the driver. Some carmakers have already developed ways of using GPS or cameras to detect posted speed limits and make sure vehicles adhere to them. European Commissioner El\u017cbieta Bie\u0144kowska said in a statement that 25,000 people are killed each year on European roads, with the vast majority of accidents being caused by human error. Volvo limits its cars' top speed to 112 miles per hour for safety \"With the new advanced safety features that will become mandatory, we can have the same kind of impact as when the safety belts were first introduced,\" she said. Read More The rules, which also mandate crash data recorders and reversing cameras, were hailed by safety advocates. But others raised concerns over the risk of drivers becoming complacent and less focused on the road conditions. The European Automotive Manufacturers Association also has concerns about the technology. It warned last year of \"many infrastructure-related issues holding back its widespread application.\" It said that road signs are not standardized across Europe, making speed limits difficult to detect. Digital maps lack speed limit information for many roads, and the data is not always current. \"That is why intelligent speed assistance systems should be introduced gradually in cars to provide enough time to update our infrastructure,\" it said in December. Intelligent speed assistance systems don't automatically apply the brakes when a car is going too fast. Instead, they limit engine power to keep vehicles to the speed limit unless overridden by the driver. Volkswagen is betting its future on electric cars Some European automakers see an advantage in limiting speeds.

But Southwest's problems extend beyond Boeing.\nThe airline warned investors Wednesday that it has canceled 9,400 flights because of weather and its dispute with mechanics in addition to Boeing's grounding of the 737 Max airplane. Southwest said the number of seats it has to sell this quarter will be much lower than it previously expected because it isn't flying as many planes. It said 2,800 of the cancellations were because of the Boeing ( BA ) 737 Max grounding. The airline also disclosed that has cut back on the number of flights through April 20 in anticipation of a continued grounding of its 737 Max planes. Southwest also said it will lose a total of 2,800 flights during the quarter because of \"unscheduled maintenance disruptions arising from contract negotiations \" with its mechanics union. The union has disputed the airline's claim that members are calling off sick or ordering extra work to put pressure on management during labor talks. Read More The company said it also lost 3,400 flights because of worse-than-expected weather during the quarter. It had previously said softness in passenger bookings because of the government shutdown would cost it $60 million during the quarter. It said the latest problems with 737 Max grounding, the maintenance issues and weather would cost it an additional $150 million during the quarter that ends on Sunday. Southwest's ( LUV ) stock was more than 1% lower in premarket trading. Southwest has more of the 737 Max planes than any other US airline. American and United Airlines ( UAL ) also have the planes in their fleets. On Sunday American Airlines ( AAL ) , the world's largest airline, announced it was canceling flights through April 24. The planes were grounded on March 13 , following two fatal crashes in a little more than five months. Although Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration said they are working on a software fix for the automatic safety feature that is the focus of those crash investigations, the global grounding of the jets is for an indefinite period of time.

It's got to change.\" Biden regrets that Anita Hill 'paid a terrible price': 'I wish I could have done something' The former vice president also lamented his role in the 1991 confirmation hearings of Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas, during which Anita Hill alleged she faced sexual harassment by Thomas. At the time, Biden was a Delaware senator who was chairing the Senate Judiciary Committee, and progressives have since criticized his handling of the hearings into her accusations, which ultimately did not derail Thomas' ascension to the Supreme Court. \"We knew a lot less about the extent of harassment back then, over 30 years ago. She paid a terrible price. She was abused for the hearing. She was taken advantage of. Her reputation was attacked. I wish I could have done something,\" Biden said Tuesday. \"To this day, I regret I couldn't come up with a way to get her the kind of hearing she deserved, given the courage she showed by reaching out to us.\" Read More Biden noted there was a \"real and perceived problem the committee faced. They were a bunch of white guys.\" He added that when Hill, who is African-American, \"came and testified, she faced a committee that didn't fully understand what the hell it was all about.\" Biden's statement drew some criticism on social media from progressives, who believe he could have done more in his role overseeing the hearings. Cillizza: Joe Biden's Anita Hill apology is a reminder of his biggest 2020 weakness \"It literally does not matter what else Biden says about sexual assault if he cannot acknowledge his own culpability in putting a sexual assaulter on the Supereme Court and then pretending for years like he was powerless to stop it. #BelieveSurvivors #IBelieveAnita,\" Jess Morales Rocketto, political director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, tweeted. Biden's expression of regret comes as he nears a decision on whether he'll mount a presidential bid for the third time. His handling of the Hill testimony is one of the many areas of Biden's career that is set to come under fresh scrutiny, particularly in the wake of the #MeToo movement. Biden has long worked to address issues of domestic violence and sexual assault, writing the Violence Against Women Act and acting as a leading figure in the Obama administration's It's On Us initiative, which aims to end sexual assault on college campuses.

That same year, hundreds of children were expelled from schools for scribbling on the President's face in their books. Nkurunziza, who has been in office since 2005, was re-elected to a third term in 2015 despite massive protests and concerns over the legality of running beyond his second term.

The EU rules don't mandate specific technology for the systems, which can be temporarily overridden by the driver. Some carmakers have already developed ways of using GPS or cameras to detect posted speed limits and make sure vehicles adhere to them. European Commissioner El\u017cbieta Bie\u0144kowska said in a statement that 25,000 people are killed each year on European roads, with the vast majority of accidents being caused by human error. Volvo limits its cars' top speed to 112 miles per hour for safety \"With the new advanced safety features that will become mandatory, we can have the same kind of impact as when the safety belts were first introduced,\" she said. Read More The rules, which also mandate crash data recorders and reversing cameras, were hailed by safety advocates. But others raised concerns over the risk of drivers becoming complacent and less focused on the road conditions. The European Automotive Manufacturers Association also has concerns about the technology. It warned last year of \"many infrastructure-related issues holding back its widespread application.\" It said that road signs are not standardized across Europe, making speed limits difficult to detect. Digital maps lack speed limit information for many roads, and the data is not always current. \"That is why intelligent speed assistance systems should be introduced gradually in cars to provide enough time to update our infrastructure,\" it said in December. Intelligent speed assistance systems don't automatically apply the brakes when a car is going too fast. Instead, they limit engine power to keep vehicles to the speed limit unless overridden by the driver.

So, how did Smollett get cleared of all charges? Here's what several CNN analysts had to say about the latest twist in the case and the possible reasoning behind it. Did authorities have enough evidence? Police in Chicago found several pieces of evidence that led them to believe that Smollett orchestrated the attack. Read More Investigators had footage of the men involved in the alleged assault buying a ski mask, sunglasses and other items. They also had a check that Smollett used to pay one of them. But no surveillance cameras captured the incident and one of the men was actually Smollett's personal trainer, the actor's attorneys said. If prosecutors saw holes in their case, they had to do the \"best they could do in the interest of justice.\" \"I'd like to give them the benefit of the doubt and believe they looked at the evidence and didn't feel they could prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt,\" said Sara Azari, a criminal defense attorney. Was there concern he'd already been tried in the court of public opinion? Smollett's transformation from victim to suspect in the reported attack captured national headlines. Celebrities and politicians lent their fervent support and others doubted the actor's claims. Meanwhile, police got into a difficult situation, Azari said. They quickly tried their case in the court of public opinion. As Smollett was being accused of filing a false police report, Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson notoriously lambasted him in a news conference for wasting police resources. He also pointed out that officers were \"pissed\" when they learned Smollett's alleged true motive. Authorities said he had staged the attack because he was unhappy with his salary. For Joey Jackson, CNN legal analyst and criminal defense attorney, police actions were an overstep. \"How does he ever get a fair trial when you have the superintendent going on 'Good Morning America' blasting him,\" he said. \"You have wonder whether or not they overplayed their hand,\" Jackson added. \"That is that they just went after him so relentlessly on everything else that it poisoned the jury pool.\" Were the brothers not credible? A major twist in the case came when police alleged that Smollett hired two brothers and paid them $3,500 to stage the attack. Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo were arrested last month after police tracked the cabs and rideshare cars they used before the attack. The men eventually confessed to the alleged plot and appeared before a grand jury but they were released without charges. Laura Coates, a former federal prosecutor, said the Osundairo brothers could have had a role into the prosecutors' decision to drop Smollett's charges. \"Maybe it's a matter of the two brothers who as late as February and March did not have a plea agreement, did not have an immunity deal,\" Coates said. \"They may have recanted, meaning they changed their tune. How do you prove it then?\" CNN has reached out to the brothers' attorney for comment. Earlier this month, the brothers said they had \"tremendous regret\" for their involvement in the incident. Did they seek a deferred prosecution instead? The Cook County State's Attorney's Office dropped all charges against Smollett on Tuesday but released little about why it abandoned the 16 felony disorderly conduct charges. The lead prosecutor in the case said they reviewed the case's facts and considered Smollett's volunteer service in the community as well as his willingness to forfeit his $10,000 bond. He also noted that Smollett had no prior felonies and wasn't a danger to the community. \"That to me sounds like a deferred prosecution,\" Coates, the former federal prosecutor, said. \"It is quite common,\" she said. \"Prosecutors thinking about reviewing the evidence decide that maybe a criminal solution or criminal prosecution is no longer the most effective way to reach justice.\" Speaking to reporters, Smollett's attorney, Patricia Holmes, denied that the prosecutors' decision to drop the charges was part of a deal or a deferred prosecution. First Assistant State's Attorney Joseph Magats, the lead prosecutor, told CNN affiliate WLS that dropping the charges did not mean the actor was exonerated. When asked whether he considered Smollett to be innocent, the prosecutor told WLS: \"No.\" \"This is not celebrity justice. This case is well too high profile for a District Attorney's office to just hand over a gift of exoneration to Jussie Smollett,\" Azari said. Did they make a secret deal? The secrecy surrounding the details of the sudden dismissal of Smollett's charges has left some people calling for greater transparency from the prosecutors office and has led to speculation. A judge agreed to seal Smollett's court file at the request of his attorneys and without the opposition from prosecutors. Johnson, who had expressed his disappointment over the dismissal, criticized the move suggesting that defense attorneys brokered a deal to \"circumvent the judicial system.\" JUST WATCHED Ex-police chief: Police and mayor thrown under the bus Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH\nEx-police chief: Police and mayor thrown under the bus 02:13 \"Nothing has changed other than the fact that this guy got to the state's attorney's office somehow and they worked out a back door deal that threw the mayor and the police department under the bus. Period,\" said Former Philadelphia police commissioner Charles Ramsey, agreeing with Johnson.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D), one of the leading voices for the legislation, went off on those who mock the effort as nothing more than an elitist fantasy.\nIt began when Wisconsin Rep. Sean Duffy (R) introduced an amendment in a meeting of the Financial Services Committee that would force a homelessness bill that was being debated to meet \"green\" standards. \"The Green New Deal is one that if you are a rich liberal from maybe New York or California it sounds great because you can afford to retrofit your home or build a new home that has a zero emissions, that is energy efficient, affordable and safe,\" he said. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE!\nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\nCue AOC. You should watch the entire two minutes of what she said , but here's the key part: \"When we talk about the concern for the environment as an elitist concern, one year ago I was waitressing in a taco shop in downtown Manhattan. I just got health insurance for the first time a month ago. This is not an elitist issue. This is a quality of life issue. You want to tell people that their concern and their desire for clean air and clean water is elitist? Tell that to the kids in the South Bronx which are suffering from the highest rates of childhood asthma in the country. Tell that to the families in Flint whose kids, their blood is ascending in lead levels, their brains are damaged for the rest of their lives. Call them elitist. You're telling them that those kids are trying to get on a plane to Davos? People are dying!\" The clip of Ocasio-Cortez's speech, which was tweeted by liberal activist Brian Tyler Cohen at 8:32 p.m. Eastern Tuesday night , already has 4.7 million views. It had been retweeted almost 50,000 times and had almost 125,000 likes as of Wednesday morning. Read More Watch every second of this... @AOC is so incredibly spot on. pic.twitter.com/ESP4dC5TTo\n\u2014 Brian Tyler Cohen (@briantylercohen) March 27, 2019 Those are absolutely staggering numbers. But they speak to the chord that AOC has touched among liberals in the country. She is, without any question, one of the biggest stars in the Democratic Party at the moment -- and that includes the roughly 73 candidates who are running for president at the moment. (Here's one anecdote that speaks to the Ocasio-Cortez sensation: At the SXSW festival earlier this month in Austin, Texas, the line to get into to see her speak ran the length of two full floors of a massive convention center. I went to a live taping of Binge Mode's \"Talk the Thrones\" which was happening at the same time. Got to get that \"Game of Thrones\" content!) And the clip above shows why. Unlike some Democrats who shrink when attacked as elitists by Republicans, Ocasio-Cortez takes that charge on directly -- by leaning heavily into her own personal story. It is a remarkable story of an unbelievably rapid ascent into the upper echelons of national Democratic politics. And it is a story rooted not in fancy schools or a stack of graduate degrees but rather in AOC's own very middle class life prior to being elected to Congress. It resonates with Democrats because it is authentic. Then there is the fact, as the clip demonstrates, that AOC is not willing to let herself or the issues she cares about be stereotyped by Republicans. Climate change isn't about the carbon footprint Al Gore leaves when he jets into Davos to deliver a speech, argues Ocasio-Cortez. Instead it's about kids in places like New York City and Flint, Michigan whose lives are being negatively affected -- and in possibly permanent ways by a lack of clean air and clean water. You can see it all -- the smarts, the unapologetic nature and the passionate conviction -- in that clip. For all the devotion and plaudits AOC draws on the left, she pulls in just as much derision and anger on the right.

They also tried and failed to get one man to defect, authorities said in the statement. The name Adrian Hong is well known in North Korean human rights activist circles. A person by that same name testified before the Canadian Senate in 2016 criticizing the Kim regime. CNN's attempts to reach Hong for comment were unsuccessful. Spanish authorities had kept the case under wraps until Tuesday , when Judge Jos\u00e9 de la Mata ordered court documents unsealed. According to those court documents, Hong -- a Mexican national and US resident -- was the one who led the assault. Spanish authorities said that Hong fled Spain after the attack for Lisbon, before making his way to the United States. He then got in touch with the FBI to share information \"relevant to the incident as well as audiovisual material supposedly obtained,\" per Spanish judicial authorities. Read More The FBI declined to comment on the case. Hours after Judge Mata's statement was released, a Korean activist group dedicated to overthrowing the Kim regime called the Cheollima Civil Defense (CCD) released a statement claiming responsibility for the incident. The group said it was responding to an \"urgent situation\" and was \"invited into the embassy.\" CCD denied it had used any violence. The Cheollima Civil Defense first gained international recognition after it reportedly provided refuge for Kim Han Sol, the son of Kim Jong Nam. Kim Jong Nam, the elder half-brother of North Korea's leader, was exposed to the deadly nerve agent VX in 2017 while entering an airport in Kuala Lumpur, killing him in minutes. US, South Korean and Malaysian authorities have pinned the attack on Pyongyang, but North Korea has adamantly denied any responsibility. Lawyer Lee Wolosky, who represents the group, said there \"there are a number of statements attributed to the Judge in media reports that do not accurately reflect what happened in Madrid.\" \"It was, in any event, highly irresponsible to disclose publicly the names of people who are working in opposition to a brutal regime that routinely and summarily executes its enemies,\" Wolosky said in a statement to CNN. \"The Spanish judge purported to reach conclusions without any input from representatives of Free Joseon,\" Wolosky said, using another name that CCD goes by. A view of North Korea's embassy in Madrid on Thursday, February 28. The Cheollima Civil Defense said in its statement that revealing the identity of its members could put them in danger. The group accused US government sources of leaking their role in the raid to the media, and thereby committing \"abhorrent acts pursued in the name of political expediency, in service to a regime who has tortured and killed millions.\" \"Some of us will be imprisoned, tortured or killed in the course of this fight. But to share information that may help identify any of us who take risks to protect others is to aid and abet the regime in Pyongyang,\" the statement read. Hong is a known commodity among the close-knit group of activists, journalists and academics who cover human rights in North Korea. As a college student, Hong helped found Liberty in North Korea, an NGO that has helped hundreds of North Koreans defect. However, Hong has \"had no involvement with the organization for over ten years,\" Hannah Song, the organization's current CEO, said in a statement. \"We have no knowledge of his recent activities, and we have no information on the Madrid Embassy incident other than what has been published by the media.\" In recent public appearances, Hong has been identified as president of the Joseon Institute, a think tank studying \"increasingly imminent, dramatic change\" in North Korea. Jean Lee, a North Korea expert at the Wilson Center, said she remembers Hong from speaking on a panel with him in 2012. \"He's a very intense guy and very committed to North Korea and very dogmatic,\" Lee said. \"He comes up in conversation on a regular basis in that circle.\" Lee, who as a reporter for The Associated Press opened the company's bureau in Pyongyang, told CNN she had no knowledge of Hong's involvement with the group before media reports first surfaced, but said she long suspected that the person behind the mysterious group was not a native Korean speaker. Lee said that English versions of their announcements were grammatically sound but they usually seemed stilted in Korean, as if they were translated verbatim. The group also used a distinctly South Korean spelling of Cheollima, Lee said.

Nitrogen oxides, including nitrogen dioxide, are tailpipe pollutants, entering the air due to burning fuel.\nCannabis-related ER visits in Colorado jump threefold after legalization, study says \"One of the most consistent findings over the past few decades has been a link between cities and psychosis,\" Joanne Newbury , lead author of the study and a postdoctoral researcher at King's College London, said Tuesday. \"Children who are born and raised in urban versus rural settings are almost twice as likely to develop psychosis in adulthood.\" An association but not a cause-effect relationship For the study, published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, Newbury and her co-authors explored whether psychotic experiences are more common among teens exposed to higher levels of air pollution. They used data from a study with more than 2,000 participants, all born in England and Wales in 1994 and 1995. Researchers have followed up with each child repeatedly at ages 5, 7, 10, 12 and most recently at 18, Newbury explained. They were asked in a private interview, \"Have you ever heard voices that other people cannot hear? Have you thought you were being followed or spied on?\" Daily or high-potency cannabis increases risk of psychotic disorder, study finds Read More Dr. Helen Fisher, a study co-author and a reader of developmental psychopathology at King's College London, said Tuesday that \"when we talk about psychotic experiences, we are talking about people who are experiencing things like hearing or seeing things other people don't or feeling very paranoid.\" Such symptoms -- which \"are actually quite common in the general population,\" she said -- are considered \"to be a kind of milder or less extreme form of the kind of psychotic symptom like hallucinations or delusions that we see in people who experience psychotic disorders like schizophrenia.\" A total of 623 (or 30%) of the teens reported at least one psychotic experience between ages 12 and 18. Next, the researchers gathered hourly emissions data from monitoring sites to assess pollution levels in the places where each teen spent the most time: a home address and two other places such as school. Young people on amphetamines for ADHD have twice the psychosis risk compared to other stimulants, study says Psychotic experiences were significantly more common among teens in the highest quartile of pollution exposure, even after the researchers accounted for factors that might also be linked to psychosis, such as cigarette smoking, cannabis dependence and neighborhood crime levels. The teens exposed to top-quartile levels of nitrogen dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter ( PM2.5 , fine inhalable particles derived from chemical smoke) had 71%, 72% and 45% greater odds, respectively, of psychotic experiences compared with those exposed to the lowest-quartile levels. \"Odds gradually increase as you move from rural to suburb to urban settings,\" Newbury said, with teens living in the \"most urban settings\" having \"94% greater odds of psychotic experiences compared to those living in rural settings.\" Newbury cautioned that this is not a cause-and-effect relationship but an association between air pollution and psychosis. What is K2? Although road traffic is responsible for most of the air pollution studied, Fisher said, \"it could really be noise pollution that explains what is happening here.\" Noise disrupts sleep and causes stress, and both are associated with psychotic experiences, she explained. However, if air pollution is causing psychosis, Fisher speculates that the gases and particles might be causing brain inflammation, which previous research suggests may be linked to psychosis. Pollutants could also be \"stunting brain development\" during sensitive periods, which might be linked to psychosis, Fisher said: \"Seventy-five percent of all mental health problems are going to start during this adolescent period, so it's a really good period to go in and prevent some of those longer-term issues.\" What to make of the findings Dr. Jim van Os, a professor and head of the Brain Division at University Medical Center Utrecht, wrote in an email that the paper is \"nice\" but lacks rigor. Exposure to infection in the womb increases risk of autism and depression, study says The finding is \"highly press sensitive\" and \"drawn from a study with literally thousands of variables,\" noted van Os, who has researched and explored psychosis but was not involved in the new research. At best, it is \"a hypothesis to examine in future work. In the absence of replication it does not mean much and is most likely a false positive finding.\" Sophie Dix , a cognitive researcher and director of research at MQ, a nonprofit that funds mental health research, told the Science Media Centre that \"there is more work that needs to be done with this study.\" Slashing fossil fuel use could save millions of lives at risk due to air pollution, study says \"There is no evidence that pollution necessarily causes psychosis or whether this is one of many factors or acting in isolation,\" said Dix, who was not involved in the research. \"There is a bigger picture here, but that does not diminish the importance of these findings and the potential that comes from this.\" Stefan Reis, who heads the Atmospheric Chemistry and Effects Unit at the NERC Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, a research organization, told Science Media Centre that \"the study makes a valuable contribution to the growing body of evidence that air pollution may affect more than just cardio-vascular and respiratory health.\" Reis, who did not participate in the study, said other variables worth exploring could include \"academic attainment in early life stages and cognitive decline in old age due to early-life exposure to air pollution.\" It's important, he concluded, to further our understanding of \"how air pollution is related to mental health outcomes which could in future have implications for air quality policies.\" ERs 'flooded' with mentally ill patients with no place else to turn Marianthi-Anna Kioumourtzoglou , an assistant professor in the Department of Environmental Health Sciences at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, wrote in an editorial published beside the study that \"air pollution exposures are ubiquitous in urban environments,\" yet they are \"modifiable and can be reduced through rigorous regulatory action.\" Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\"It is especially important to identify other factors that may potentially ameliorate the consequences of air pollution to protect human health,\" said Kioumourtzoglou, who had no role in the new research. \"These could be lifestyle, nutritional, or neighborhood-level factors.\" \"As the global population is becoming increasingly urban, it is of utmost importance to incorporate public environmental health into urban planning decisions.\" In the words of the study's authors: \"Given that 70% of the world's population will be urban by 2050, uncovering the mechanisms linking the urban environment to psychosis and developing preventive interventions constitute an urgent health priority.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/helen.2.fisher.html", "https://www.umcutrecht.nl/nl/Over-Ons/Nieuws/2017/Jim-van-Os-nieuwe-medisch-manager-divisie-Hersenen", "https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/joanne.b.newbury.html", "https://www.mqmentalhealth.org/articles/employees", "https://mailchi.mp/cnn/resultsarein", "https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/mk3961", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Van+Os+J%5Bau%5D+psychosis", "https://www.ceh.ac.uk/staff/stefan-reis", "https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/particulate-matter-pm-basics"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joanne newbury", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jama psychiatry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "king's college london", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "newbury", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorado", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-03-27T17:23:55.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "838dee2ba48a9b596324bdeaba03c425fda321ed", "url": "http://us.cnn.com/2019/03/27/health/eggs-good-or-bad-where-do-we-stand/index.html", "site_full": "us.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://us.cnn.com/health", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Health News - CNN", "title": "Eggs: Are they good or bad for your health?", "title_full": "Eggs: Are they good or bad for your health?

The 2015 to 2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends the nutrient-dense food as a source of protein, but an article in JAMA this month made a stir when it reported an association between eating eggs and an increased risk of heart disease and early death .\nEating eggs in moderation may be beneficial to heart health, but recent research says excessive egg consumption is associated with increased risk of heart disease. The risk identified in the JAMA research was linked to eating, on top of your regular diet, an additional three to four eggs per week, or 300 milligrams of dietary cholesterol a day. Previous studies show decreased and no heart disease risk in those who ate up to one egg a day. Three or more eggs a week increase your risk of heart disease and early death, study says Though eggs provide protein, minerals, vitamins and other nutrients, the yolk is also a major source of cholesterol. According to the US Department of Agriculture , the yolk of one large raw egg contains 184 milligrams of cholesterol. High cholesterol levels are a risk factor for cardiovascular events like a heart attack or stroke, according to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute . However, this condition depends on many factors, like the levels of good versus bad cholesterol , genetics, lifestyle and diet. If you've been confused by whether egg consumption is good for your health, you're not alone. Let's look at the historical journey of the egg and see how the research has shifted over the years. Read More 5400 BC: Behold! A new, easy-to-hunt food source Chickens, right, descend from birds like the red junglefowl. The earliest fossils resembling chickens date to 5400 BC in Southeast Asia, according to the Smithsonian . Confirmation with genetic material shows that today's chickens descend from several prehistoric birds, one of those being the red junglefowl. The male junglefowl has spurs on its lower legs that people found useful for cockfighting. Today's domesticated chicken has a gene that controls reproduction and allows them to lay hundreds of eggs throughout the year. With domestication, chickens were introduced to the global market through trade routes an estimated 3,000 years ago . Early 1900s headline: Egg farming becomes safer Families used chickens and their eggs both as a source of income and for their own own use. In the early 1920s , conditions such as seasonality and poor storage contributed to deteriorating conditions for chickens. As the animals were moved indoors in the 1930s, they were protected against environmental factors -- weather, larger animals, disease -- and their health improved. An egg a day might reduce your risk of heart disease, study says 1950s and 1960s headline: A chicken in every pot As production increased and more hens survived, farmers noticed that their egg production was increasing. The industry of chickens became more affordable, as opposed to their previous role as a luxury food. 1968 headline: American Heart Association makes strict recommendation The group's early recommendations included no more than 300 milligrams of cholesterol per day and no more than three eggs per week. This was based on debatable animal and clinical studies. These animals are often herbivores, less adapted to digest dietary cholesterol than omnivores, like humans. Also, the clinical studies did not account for other sources of cholesterol found in a typical diet. With more research, guidelines were modified. 1970 headline: Now hiring egg inspectors As hens became more productive, food scientists and egg producers realized the need for new policy. Congress passed the Egg Products Inspection Act , which made sure eggs were safe for consumers. 1976 headline: Fictional boxer drinks raw eggs Stallone's character prepares his \"breakfast of champions\" in the film \"Rocky.\" Rocky, Sylvester Stallone's renowned boxer, famously drank raw eggs in the hit film. But research has since shown that there is more protein available for digestion in cooked eggs (approximately 91%) than raw eggs (about 51%). Consuming raw eggs also increases the risk of contracting the bacteria salmonella and developing a deficiency of biotin , a vitamin important for skin, hair and nails. Eggs contain avidin, a protein partially destroyed when cooked. In raw eggs, avidin more readily binds and reduces biotin. Rocky -- and you -- would have to consume a lot of raw egg whites to develop biotin deficiency, but it's possible . 1984 headline: Time magazine's cover features a disheartened breakfast Time magazine made its own statement on the egg debate with this disappointed face. Time magazine published a cover depicting the face of cholesterol: a plate with two fried eggs for eyes and a bacon frown. The same year, the Egg Nutrition Center was created with a goal of clarifying skepticism around cholesterol. 1995 headline: An attempt to resolve confusion To create standard dietary recommendations in the United States, organizations like the American Heart Association, the National Centers for Environmental Prediction and the FDA set a unified goal for Americans: less than 300 milligrams per day from dietary cholesterol. For reference, one large boiled egg contains 186 milligrams of dietary cholesterol. 2002 headline: American Heart Association loosens up The organization gave up its restriction on eating a certain number of eggs per week but kept the guideline of less than 300 milligrams of dietary cholesterol per day. While the United States continued its internal battle of what to do about eggs, other countries, such as Australia , began removing their national dietary guideline restrictions on eggs. 2013 headline: No association found between egg consumption and cardiovascular disease Are eggs healthy? A large meta-analysis concluded that consuming up to one egg per day is not associated with increased heart disease risk. In a literature search from 1966 to 2012, researchers looked at patients followed for coronary heart disease and a history of stroke. They found no significant association between egg consumption and heart disease. 2016 headline: Oldest living person gives credit to raw eggs Emma Morano came from a lineage of long-living women but partially attributed her long life to a diet of of raw eggs. Italy's Emma Morano earned the title of oldest living person on her 117th birthday; she has since died. Morano came from a lineage of long-living women: a mother who made it to 91 and sisters who lived to see a century. Although genes were most likely a factor, Morano partially attributed her longevity to a life of eating raw eggs. Her physician said she had great cholesterol levels. 2018 headline: An egg a day keeps the doctor away A study of more than 400,000 Chinese adults found an association between daily egg consumption and an 18% decrease in death risk related to cardiovascular disease. The authors said the country has its own dietary and lifestyle characteristics, so there should be caution in generalization. Heart disease is a leading cause of death in China and throughout the world, according to the World Health Organization .\nThe evolution, domestication and research of chickens and eggs led to our dinner tables. The most recent research states that excessive egg consumption is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, but don't forget that the types of cholesterol, genetics and lifestyle factors play a role, too. While you keep that in mind, we'll be here awaiting the next study or guideline change.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.bmj.com/content/346/bmj.e8539", "https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/01.cir.0000020190.45892.75", "https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/114?format=Full", "https://www.cdc.gov/features/salmonellaeggs/index.html", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5329726/", "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0039171", "https://unitedegg.com/about/evolution-of-u-s-egg-farming/", "https://mailchi.mp/cnn/resultsarein", "https://heart.bmj.com/content/104/21/1756", "https://www.cdc.gov/cholesterol/ldl_hdl.htm", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3572442/", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4632449/", "https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/high-blood-cholesterol", "https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/01129?fgcd=&manu=&format=&count=&max=25&offset=&sort=default&order=asc&qlookup=egg%2C+boiled&ds=SR&qt=&qp=&qa=&qn=&q=&ing=", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5188439/", "https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cardiovascular-diseases-(cvds)", "https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article-abstract/21/2/173/4787943", "https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/how-the-chicken-conquered-the-world-87583657/", "https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2728487", "http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19840326,00.html", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4465628/", "https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Biotin-HealthProfessional/", "https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-84/pdf/STATUTE-84-Pg1620.pdf", "https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/resources/2015-2020_Dietary_Guidelines.pdf", "https://www.eggnutritioncenter.org/", "https://www.eatforhealth.gov.au/sites/default/files/files/the_guidelines/n55_australian_dietary_guidelines(2).pdf", "https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/128/10/1716/4723080"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "us department of agriculture", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-03-27T17:25:27.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9e57d5d3e4c81914fa27debdce8af7b14eb86e1a", "url": "http://us.cnn.com/2019/03/27/health/statins-eligible-adults-study/index.html", "site_full": "us.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://us.cnn.com/health", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Health News - CNN", "title": "Physicians fail to offer statins to more than half of eligible patients, study says", "title_full": "Physicians fail to offer statins to more than half of eligible patients, study says - CNN", "published": "2019-03-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.825, "main_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170306180001-what-are-statins-cholesterol-sje-orig-00000000-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9e57d5d3e4c81914fa27debdce8af7b14eb86e1a", "url": "http://us.cnn.com/2019/03/27/health/statins-eligible-adults-study/index.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Dr. Edith Bracho-Sanchez, CNN", "published": "2019-03-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Physicians fail to offer statins to more than half of eligible patients, study says", "text": "(CNN) More than half of eligible American adults who are not on a cholesterol-lowering medication, or statin, say it's because their physician did not offer the option, according to new research.\nStatins' benefits beyond heart health aren't clear-cut, analysis says Researchers surveyed 5,693 people from the Patient and Provider Assessment of Lipid Management Registry, a national database of doctor practices across the United States. A total of 1,511 of the adults were not receiving treatment with a statin, despite meeting eligibility criteria for the medication according to 2013 American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines. A majority -- 59% -- of those 1,511 cited the fact that their physician never offered the medication. Ten percent reported declining statins after their physician recommended them, and 30.7% had taken a statin but had chosen to stop, according to the study, published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Heart Association. Those who say they were never offered a statin were more likely to be women, African-American and uninsured, according to the study. After years of uncertainty, study finds statins can benefit all ages, including those over 75 Statins work by lowering the amount of \"bad\" cholesterol, known as low-density lipoprotein or LDL. Because the drugs can lower the risk of heart attacks and strokes, the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology recommend that doctors use a 10-year risk calculator to determine which patients may benefit from such therapy. Read More Over 78 million Americans, or just over a third of all adults, are eligible for statin therapy or are already taking a statin, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"We need to focus our efforts on improving how doctors identify patients who need to be on a statin, and how they present information to patients to ensure that no one is missing the opportunity to improve their heart health,\" said Dr. Corey Bradley, lead author of the study and a researcher at the Duke Clinical Research Institute in Durham, North Carolina, in a statement. Are statins overprescribed? Why the risks and benefits are so complex Among those who were offered a statin but declined, the most common reason was fear of side effects. \"Although there are risks associated with statins, the public fear of side effects is out of proportion to the actual risks,\" said Dr. Ann Marie Navar, senior author of the study and assistant professor of medicine at the Duke Clinical Research Institutem in a statement. \"Misconceptions about statins are everywhere and are fueled by false information on the internet.\" Weighing the risks and benefits of a lifelong medication like statins is important, says Dr. Amit Khera, director of the UT Southwestern Medical Center's Preventive Cardiology Program, who was not involved in the study. When Khera counsels his own patients about statins, the three side effects they most commonly ask about are muscle aches, changes in cognitive function and liver function. New study suggests fish oil derivative may benefit heart health \"Statins can cause muscle aches, but even if it's as high as one in 10 who get muscle aches, that means 9 in 10 will not. For the vast majority, that won't happen, and it generally goes away when we stop the statin,\" Khera said. As for concerns about cognitive decline, \"it is not something seen in large studies, so if it does occur, it is infrequent and hard to separate from the usual cognitive decline of aging,\" he said. Additionally, \"we realized over time that minor increases in liver function tests are not clinically significant, as statins very rarely cause serious liver damage for patients,\" he said. The authors acknowledge that the new study had several limitations. Because it included patients who were part of a national registry and were potentially eligible for statin therapy, they believe that the results may underestimate the number of people who go without receiving statins.\nWith a survey study, the team acknowledges, the results are subject to recall bias, meaning patients who ultimately started taking a statin were more likely to remember it being offered to them. \"It is possible that some people did not remember being offered a statin, so we may have over-estimated the percent who were never offered one. However, we believe that if the patient did not remember the conversation, the discussion likely was not an effective one,\" Bradley said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2015/p1203-cholesterol-medicine.html", "https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/01.cir.0000437738.63853.7a", "https://mailchi.mp/cnn/resultsarein", "http://tools.acc.org/ASCVD-Risk-Estimator-Plus/#!/calculate/estimate/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "american college of cardiology and american heart association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heart association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "provider assessment of lipid management registry", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-03-27T17:37:04.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "19948a674001b8ee983149c5a7dd5b9926d27db0", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/26/europe/longyearbyen-doomsday-vault-climate-change-intl/index.html?utm_source=CNN+Five+Things&utm_campaign=e39032cbde-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_03_27_07_38&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_6da287d761-e39032cbde-90388429", "site_full": "edition.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "'Doomsday vault' town warming faster than any other on Earth - CNN", "title_full": "'Doomsday vault' town warming faster than any other on Earth - CNN", "published": "2019-03-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.999, "main_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190304164553-05-longyearbyen-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "19948a674001b8ee983149c5a7dd5b9926d27db0", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/26/europe/longyearbyen-doomsday-vault-climate-change-intl/index.html?utm_source=CNN+Five+Things&utm_campaign=e39032cbde-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_03_27_07_38&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_6da287d761-e39032cbde-90388429", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sarah Lazarus, CNN", "published": "2019-03-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "'Doomsday vault' town warming faster than any other on Earth - CNN", "text": "(CNN) In 2014, Mark Sabbatini noticed cracks in his apartment walls. Then a mysterious bulge appeared in his bedroom and the apartment block's communal staircase became crooked. \"Doors and windows weren't shutting properly,\" he says.\nSabbatini, the editor of a local newspaper , was living in Longyearbyen, the world's northernmost town located just 800 miles from the North Pole, which is also the capital of a cluster of Norwegian islands called Svalbard. Melting permafrost caused these cracks in Mark Sabbatini's apartment block. A landscape of jagged mountains, fjords and glaciers, Svalbard -- which experiences four months of darkness in winter, and four months of daylight in summer -- is built on permanently frozen ground called permafrost. For years, permafrost provided a base as hard as concrete. But now it's melting --- and that's proving to be a problem. Sabbatini says his building was damaged because it started sinking into the softening ground. Read More Inger Hanssen-Bauer, senior researcher at the Norwegian Meteorological Institute and editor of a new report about Svalbard, says the climate in Longyearbyen is probably warming faster than in any other town on Earth. That's because of accelerated Arctic warming -- as rising temperatures reduce ice and snow cover, less sunlight is reflected and more solar energy is absorbed by the darker surfaces that have been exposed. Arctic ice cover in 2018 was significantly less than in 1980. According to Hanssen-Bauer, the annual mean temperature in Longybearbyen in 1900 was -7.8\u00b0C. Since then, it has risen by 3.7\u00b0C -- more than three times the global average of around 1\u00b0C . The town increasingly experiences days when the temperature exceeds zero. \"All the projections show that this will continue,\" she says. The weather hasn't only got hotter, it's also got wetter. In the late 20th century, annual rainfall in Longyearbyen was about 200 millimeters (7.9 inches), says Hanssen-Bauer. But in the past decade, the town has suffered occasional torrential downpours of 50 millimeters (2 inches) of rain in a day. Longyearbyen is the world's northernmost town. The changing climate could endanger the lives of Longyearbyen's residents, is starving the animals that live in its hinterland and has imperiled an institution which safeguards the world's crop supply. Homes under threat In spring 2017, Christiane H\u00fcbner loaded her seaside cabin onto a huge sled and moved it 80 meters (262 feet) inland. The permafrost on which her home once stood had become soggy in the warmer, wetter weather, and was being rapidly eroded by the sea. Christiane Hubner's hut is loaded onto the sled that will transport it to inland to a safe location. The previous winter, high waves had washed away 13 meters (43 feet) of shore in one day, she says. That left her cabin perched a precarious four meters (13 feet) from the water's edge. Many of Longyearbyen's buildings are vulnerable because they are built on wooden pillars sunk into the permafrost. In the new climate, the pillars become wet and start to rot, destabilizing the houses. Most dangerous of all, though, are the avalanches, which are more likely to occur with heavy rain and degraded permafrost. A drone captured the aftermath of the avalanche that hit Longyearbyen in 2015. In December 2015, a fierce storm triggered an avalanche that sent snow, ice and rocks hurtling down a mountain onto houses, killing a 42-year-old man and a two-year-old girl. Christiane H\u00fcbner says her dogs narrowly escaped death in 2016 when a mudslide hit the yard where the animals live. In 2017, a second major avalanche hit the town and destroyed more homes. Search and rescue crews at work after the December 2015 avalanche. \"We can't trust the permafrost anymore,\" says Hege Njaa Aschim, communications manager for Statsbygg, the Norwegian government agency responsible for real estate, which owns 75% of the town's buildings. Statsbygg is building 60 apartments at a safe distance from the mountain slopes and assessing how many of its properties need to be torn down and replaced. Instead of wooden pillars, the new homes use long steel poles that are driven through the permafrost into the bedrock. Additionally, the buildings are equipped with sensors that detect temperature, rainfall and movement and alert authorities to any worrying changes regarding the apartments. \"We're taking no chances,\" says Aschim. Longyearbyen is home to the world's northernmost church. It has been earmarked as one of the first buildings that Statsbygg will renovate. For some, the construction of climate change-proof homes is not happening fast enough. Sabbatini, the newspaper editor, had to leave his apartment in February 2016, after the city government ordered an immediate evacuation. He has not been able to return to his apartment, but has stayed in Longyearbyen thanks to the help and financial support of his friends and readers. Others have not been so lucky. Sabbatini says that as a result of the destruction and evacuations, \"affordable, vacant flats are incredibly hard to come by.\" Some of his friends have been forced to leave town, while others have resorted to living in campsites or non-residential buildings such a boathouses, he adds. Saving the world's seeds Just outside Longyearbyen is a building that must be protected at all costs. Often referred to as the \"doomsday vault,\" the Svalbard Global Seed Vault stores copies of the world's crop seeds. It was created to act as a back-up in case of catastrophes such as disease, pests, war -- and climate change. The vault holds nearly 1 million packets of seeds originating from almost every country in the world, including everyday staples such as wheat and rice, as well as rare species such as the critically endangered Bermuda bean . \"Svalbard is the ultimate failsafe for biodiversity of crops,\" says Marie Haga, executive director of the Crop Trust, which built the vault in 2008 in partnership with the Norwegian government. Haga says Longyearbyen is the perfect spot for the seed vault because the area is not prone to volcanoes or earthquakes, while the Norwegian political system is also \"extremely stable.\" Nearly a million seed samples are stored in the Svalbard Global Seed Vault. The vault is set deep inside a mountain, looks a bit like the lair of a James Bond villain and is accessed by a 120 meter (400 feet) long tunnel. Due to the climate, it is relatively easy to cool the vault's air to the required temperature of -18\u00b0C (-0.4\u00b0F) But as soon as the seed bank opened, it became clear there were going to be problems. Typically, permafrost that is disturbed by construction work will re-freeze over time says Haga. But against expectations, the ground around the vault's entrance tunnel never re-froze. In October 2016, during heavy rainfall, water flooded half the tunnel floor and froze into blocks of ice. Although the water did not reach the vault itself, \"we knew action had to be taken\", says Haga. Construction work on the seed vault's new service building and tunnel entrance. Statsbygg undertook 100 million Norwegian krone ($11.7 million) of reconstruction work, more than double the original cost of the structure. \"We replaced the steel entrance tunnel with a waterproof concrete tunnel,\" says Aschim. Statsbygg also transferred heat-producing electrical equipment from inside the tunnel to a separate facility and dug ditches to divert meltwater. Pipes containing a coolant were threaded through the soil, and a freezing mat laid on top of the tunnel to help the permafrost stay frozen. Wildlife in peril Kim Holmen, international director of the Norwegian Polar Institute and a resident of Longyearbyen, has been observing the former coal mining town's changing landscape for over three decades. Speaking in February, he said: \"At this time of year, we used to have a meter of ice on the fjord, I could see from my window. Now, it's open water all year round.\" Polar cod, which used to swim in the fjord, have disappeared along with the ice on which they depend. Atlantic cod have arrived in their place, swimming north to the warming waters, says Holmen. Land-bound animals cannot relocate and starving reindeer are now a common sight, says Holmen. \"During winter, reindeer stomp the ground with their front legs to get the snow away in order to graze,\" he says. But snow is increasingly giving way to rain. \"When the water hits the ground, it freezes,\" he says. The reindeer are unable to break through the ice to reach the grass below. When rain freezes and forms ice, Svalbard's reindeer are at risk of starvation. Polar bears are also going hungry. \"The floating sea ice disconnects from the land in the summer,\" explains Holmen. \"If the bears miss the ride, they are stranded on the shore for the summer.\" Unable to hunt for ring seals on the ice floes, in the past the bears would eke out the warmer months by raiding eggs on the cliffs. \"But now, because the ice disconnection occurs earlier and lasts longer, the bears run into food shortages.\" A warming future According to the new report , the average temperature in Longyearbyen is predicted to rise by 7\u00b0C to 10\u00b0C, and rainfall by 40% to 65%, by the end of the century, depending on the level of global carbon emissions. Perhaps most worrying of all, the thawing permafrost could fuel further global warming. \"Permafrost holds an immense amount of carbon -- enough to double the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere\" says Frans-Jan Parmentier, an Arctic climate scientist who conducts research at a station just outside Longyearbyen. He says it is vital to reduce manmad-e greenhouse gas emissions to prevent carbon release from happening. Kim Holmen, of the Norwegian Polar Institute, says that Longyearbyen's story is a \"forewarning\" for other parts of the world. Assumptions that present day climate change \"is not so serious,\" have been proven wrong, he says, adding that the increasing strength and frequency of extreme events \"needs attention.\" In Longyearbyen's case, the avalanches \"have changed the mood in the village quite dramatically,\" says Holmen. \"We identified ourselves as people who could 'stand the storm.'\" But that confidence has been replaced by anxiety. \"The brutality of nature used to bring joy, but now it scares people,\" says Holmen.

The project could eventually connect the carmaker's entire global supply chain, which includes 1,500 suppliers and partners at over 30,000 locations. The value of the deal was not disclosed. Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing division of the US tech giant, will provide Volkswagen with a team of developers and data scientists who will examine data from the project and make recommendations. The goal is to make Volkswagen's operations more efficient \u2014 for example by adjusting delivery times, reducing waste or identifying gaps in production.

The views expressed here are the author's. View more opinion on CNN.\n(CNN) On Monday, Jeremy Richman, 49, father of one of the Sandy Hook school shooting victims, apparently took his own life in his Newton, Connecticut, office. The third in a recent spate of suicides connected to school massacres, Richman's death is doubly horrific because since his daughter's death, he had devoted his life to preventing tragedies like Sandy Hook through a foundation he founded and named after her.\nDavid J. Morris Few subjects defeat the scientific mind like the subject of suicide. Because researchers cannot interview the dead, we can never really know why someone takes this path. It confounds researchers, defies typical human logic and delivers laser-focused pain to a victim's friends and family. And it's hard to see any sign of progress. According to 2016 data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , suicide is now the second-leading cause of death among people between the ages of 10 and 34 and the fourth leading cause of death among people between 35 and 54. In the United States, a country obsessed with gun violence and murder, there were twice as many suicides as homicides. On a certain level, understanding suicide is more of a spiritual question than a medical one. As Albert Camus put it in \"The Myth of Sisyphus,\" \"Judging whether life is or is not worth living amounts to answering the fundamental question of philosophy.\" The truth of the matter is that nearly all suicides cause more pain than they prevent, and research indicates that one suicide can breed others . For this reason, more than one researcher has compared suicide to a contagion. The waves of the event ripple ever outward, like a stone dropped into a still pond. As one mother whose son took his own life told journalist Andrew Solomon , \"I feel as though my fingers are caught in a slamming door and I've been stopped permanently midscream.\" JUST WATCHED Parkland school shooting survivor dies by suicide Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH\nParkland school shooting survivor dies by suicide 00:29 Public accounts of suicide also help inspire suicidal behavior and elicit suicidal thoughts. Whenever a major suicide story breaks in the media, the suicide rate goes up. After Marilyn Monroe's death, which was reported widely as a suicide, the rate of suicide went up 12%. After Anthony Bourdain and Kate Spade took their own lives in 2018, the number of calls to suicide hotlines across the US spiked by 65% . Read More One of the few things we can say with any certainty is that people have been killing themselves for a very long time and that most religions are opposed to it. The ancient Greeks looked at life as a gift from the gods. In Athens those who killed themselves were denied funeral rites and the hand that had been used to commit the act was severed from the arm. From its earliest days, the Catholic Church opposed suicide. St. Augustine, in his argument against it, said that suicide violated the Sixth Commandment: \"Thou shall not murder.\" Dante took matters a few steps further in \"The Inferno,\" where those who killed themselves were condemned to live in the Seventh Circle of Hell as bleeding trees while being tortured by harpies. Despite all the official prohibitions against it, suicide has remained a constant throughout human history. Achilles, the hero of \"The Iliad,\" when he saw the dead body of Patroclus, his friend and second-in-command, had to be restrained by a fellow soldier, lest he cut his own throat. The impulse to harm oneself after trauma or the death of a loved one seems to be rooted deep in human psychology. Nor is the phenomenon of suicidal behavior as an expression of grief limited to Western society. As anthropologist Jack Goody noted in his 1962 study of the West African LoDagaa tribe, the hands of mourners were tied together with an animal hide as a precaution against self-harm after a death in the family occurred.

MUST WATCH\nParkland victim's dad reads suicide prevention questions 02:34 We will never know what prompted Richman, Sydney Aiello or another unnamed Parkland student to take their own lives. It's tempting to offer some hollow version of \"thoughts and prayers\" for people who have lost family members to suicide, but as a society we need challenge ourselves to think more creatively about what to do about it. Suicide is a kind of social epidemic seemingly exacerbated by the media and technology we binge on every day. We are spending more and more time looking at our phones and less and less time actually interacting with other human beings who might offer us an outlet to help relieve our suffering. We are spending more and more time online every day \"connecting\" with others on social media, but we've never been more socially isolated or possessed less self-knowledge. As Jaron Lanier writes in \"You Are Not A Gadget,\" his 2010 study of internet culture , \"You have to be somebody before you can share yourself.\" There are other tangible steps we can take as well. In the US, as one might expect, guns and drugs are among the most common methods of suicide. The Veterans Administration -- which is dealing with a suicide epidemic that sees an average of 20 veterans taking their lives every day -- has a longstanding policy of asking veterans undergoing treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder if they can lock up or remove any firearms in their homes in order to prevent them from killing themselves. How we talk about Kate Spade could help others survive While I don't expect to solve the gun control debate with this logic, research shows that impulsivity plays a huge role in suicide, so denying high-risk people access to firearms and dangerous drugs such as opiates could save lives. The most important thing, however, is to stop repeating the platitudes and start having a more honest and blunt conversation about suicide. Many survivors will be haunted forever by the question which lingers -- \"Why didn't he reach out for help?\" Suicide is so many things -- an act of desperation, a way of ending one's pain, a kind of mass murder and a kind of mirror held up to our world, a world that many such as Jeremy Richman found unbearable.

CNN's KFile reported that Gillibrand signed an amicus brief, submitted to the Supreme Court, that argued for overturning a handgun ban in Washington, DC, and that private gun ownership was a guaranteed right unconnected to service in a militia. Gillibrand, a New York Democrat, fought in defense of gun rights when she represented a more conservative, rural district in the US House.

The NRA pointed to her support for the amicus brief in its endorsement of her, CNN's KFile reported. After she was appointed to the US Senate in January 2009, Gillibrand shifted from her conservative record on gun rights and by September 2010, her NRA grade changed from an \"A\" to an \"F.\" \"Ten years ago, when I became US senator, I recognized that I was only focused on the needs of my upstate district, but I really should have been focusing on the needs of everyone,\" Gillibrand said on CNN's \"New Day\" Wednesday. \"I have a very proud rating of a 'F' by the NRA now,\" she added.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kirsten gillibrand", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "gillibrand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gillib", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dick cheney", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-03-27T17:51:51.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d080967a23661fee9a2a9d14b8dbe7c494a7b9a4", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/27/health/air-pollution-teen-psychosis-study/index.html", "site_full": "www.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Air pollution linked to psychosis in teens, study says - CNN", "title_full": "Air pollution linked to psychosis in teens, study says - CNN", "published": "2019-03-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.991, "main_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190326101054-02-uk-air-pollution-file-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 3893, "comments": 1206, "shares": 1620}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d080967a23661fee9a2a9d14b8dbe7c494a7b9a4", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/27/health/air-pollution-teen-psychosis-study/index.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Susan Scutti", "published": "2019-03-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Air pollution linked to psychosis in teens, study says - CNN", "text": "(CNN) An unexpected danger of urban life: Psychotic experiences are more common among teens exposed to the highest levels of nitrogen dioxide and other forms of air pollution, according to a new study. Nitrogen oxides, including nitrogen dioxide, are tailpipe pollutants, entering the air due to burning fuel.\nCannabis-related ER visits in Colorado jump threefold after legalization, study says \"One of the most consistent findings over the past few decades has been a link between cities and psychosis,\" Joanne Newbury , lead author of the study and a postdoctoral researcher at King's College London, said Tuesday. \"Children who are born and raised in urban versus rural settings are almost twice as likely to develop psychosis in adulthood.\" An association but not a cause-effect relationship For the study, published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, Newbury and her co-authors explored whether psychotic experiences are more common among teens exposed to higher levels of air pollution. They used data from a study with more than 2,000 participants, all born in England and Wales in 1994 and 1995. Researchers have followed up with each child repeatedly at ages 5, 7, 10, 12 and most recently at 18, Newbury explained. They were asked in a private interview, \"Have you ever heard voices that other people cannot hear? Have you thought you were being followed or spied on?\" Daily or high-potency cannabis increases risk of psychotic disorder, study finds Read More Dr. Helen Fisher, a study co-author and a reader of developmental psychopathology at King's College London, said Tuesday that \"when we talk about psychotic experiences, we are talking about people who are experiencing things like hearing or seeing things other people don't or feeling very paranoid.\" Such symptoms -- which \"are actually quite common in the general population,\" she said -- are considered \"to be a kind of milder or less extreme form of the kind of psychotic symptom like hallucinations or delusions that we see in people who experience psychotic disorders like schizophrenia.\" A total of 623 (or 30%) of the teens reported at least one psychotic experience between ages 12 and 18. Next, the researchers gathered hourly emissions data from monitoring sites to assess pollution levels in the places where each teen spent the most time: a home address and two other places such as school. Young people on amphetamines for ADHD have twice the psychosis risk compared to other stimulants, study says Psychotic experiences were significantly more common among teens in the highest quartile of pollution exposure, even after the researchers accounted for factors that might also be linked to psychosis, such as cigarette smoking, cannabis dependence and neighborhood crime levels. The teens exposed to top-quartile levels of nitrogen dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter ( PM2.5 , fine inhalable particles derived from chemical smoke) had 71%, 72% and 45% greater odds, respectively, of psychotic experiences compared with those exposed to the lowest-quartile levels. \"Odds gradually increase as you move from rural to suburb to urban settings,\" Newbury said, with teens living in the \"most urban settings\" having \"94% greater odds of psychotic experiences compared to those living in rural settings.\" Newbury cautioned that this is not a cause-and-effect relationship but an association between air pollution and psychosis. What is K2? Although road traffic is responsible for most of the air pollution studied, Fisher said, \"it could really be noise pollution that explains what is happening here.\" Noise disrupts sleep and causes stress, and both are associated with psychotic experiences, she explained. However, if air pollution is causing psychosis, Fisher speculates that the gases and particles might be causing brain inflammation, which previous research suggests may be linked to psychosis. Pollutants could also be \"stunting brain development\" during sensitive periods, which might be linked to psychosis, Fisher said: \"Seventy-five percent of all mental health problems are going to start during this adolescent period, so it's a really good period to go in and prevent some of those longer-term issues.\" What to make of the findings Dr. Jim van Os, a professor and head of the Brain Division at University Medical Center Utrecht, wrote in an email that the paper is \"nice\" but lacks rigor. Exposure to infection in the womb increases risk of autism and depression, study says The finding is \"highly press sensitive\" and \"drawn from a study with literally thousands of variables,\" noted van Os, who has researched and explored psychosis but was not involved in the new research. At best, it is \"a hypothesis to examine in future work. In the absence of replication it does not mean much and is most likely a false positive finding.\" Sophie Dix , a cognitive researcher and director of research at MQ, a nonprofit that funds mental health research, told the Science Media Centre that \"there is more work that needs to be done with this study.\" Slashing fossil fuel use could save millions of lives at risk due to air pollution, study says \"There is no evidence that pollution necessarily causes psychosis or whether this is one of many factors or acting in isolation,\" said Dix, who was not involved in the research. \"There is a bigger picture here, but that does not diminish the importance of these findings and the potential that comes from this.\" Stefan Reis, who heads the Atmospheric Chemistry and Effects Unit at the NERC Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, a research organization, told Science Media Centre that \"the study makes a valuable contribution to the growing body of evidence that air pollution may affect more than just cardio-vascular and respiratory health.\" Reis, who did not participate in the study, said other variables worth exploring could include \"academic attainment in early life stages and cognitive decline in old age due to early-life exposure to air pollution.\" It's important, he concluded, to further our understanding of \"how air pollution is related to mental health outcomes which could in future have implications for air quality policies.\" ERs 'flooded' with mentally ill patients with no place else to turn Marianthi-Anna Kioumourtzoglou , an assistant professor in the Department of Environmental Health Sciences at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, wrote in an editorial published beside the study that \"air pollution exposures are ubiquitous in urban environments,\" yet they are \"modifiable and can be reduced through rigorous regulatory action.\" Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\"It is especially important to identify other factors that may potentially ameliorate the consequences of air pollution to protect human health,\" said Kioumourtzoglou, who had no role in the new research. \"These could be lifestyle, nutritional, or neighborhood-level factors.\" \"As the global population is becoming increasingly urban, it is of utmost importance to incorporate public environmental health into urban planning decisions.\" In the words of the study's authors: \"Given that 70% of the world's population will be urban by 2050, uncovering the mechanisms linking the urban environment to psychosis and developing preventive interventions constitute an urgent health priority.\" ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/helen.2.fisher.html", "https://www.umcutrecht.nl/nl/Over-Ons/Nieuws/2017/Jim-van-Os-nieuwe-medisch-manager-divisie-Hersenen", "https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/joanne.b.newbury.html", "https://www.mqmentalhealth.org/articles/employees", "https://mailchi.mp/cnn/resultsarein", "https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/mk3961", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Van+Os+J%5Bau%5D+psychosis", "https://www.ceh.ac.uk/staff/stefan-reis", "https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/particulate-matter-pm-basics"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joanne newbury", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jama psychiatry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "king's college london", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "newbury", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorado", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-03-27T17:54:20.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "de83a33d4e44ea0be2126e0e75b95f05deb194b2", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/26/us/nasa-spacesuits-trnd/index.html", "site_full": "www.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "NASA's all-female spacewalk postponed: Blame microgravity -

CNN", "text": "(CNN) NASA astronauts Anne McClain and Christina Koch were set to make some history at the end of this week with the first all-female spacewalk.\nBut the moment was put on hold -- Koch will now do the spacewalk Friday with a male astronaut -- because there weren't enough spacesuits at the International Space Station that fit the two women. NASA's budget is $21.5 billion . Um, what exactly is going on up there? For an explanation, we talked to two folks from NASA's public affairs office: Brandi Dean (via email) and Stephanie Schierholz (by phone). Their answers have been edited for length. CNN: Why weren't there enough spacesuits that fit? Read More Brandi Dean : We do our best to anticipate the spacesuit sizes that each astronaut will need, based on the spacesuit size they wore in training on the ground, and in some cases (including Anne McClain's) astronauts train in multiple sizes. However, individuals' sizing needs may change when they are on orbit, in response to the changes living in microgravity can bring about in a body. In addition, no one training environment can fully simulate performing a spacewalk in microgravity, and an individual may find that their sizing preferences change in space. This is all fascinating. So body sizes change in space? Stephanie Schierholz : When you're in space, your body changes because of the lack of gravity, right? So if you're standing on Earth, gravity is pulling you down. The two most notable changes are fluid shifts in your body and most people's spine tends to elongate. And that just creates conditions where your body behaves differently in space. So combine that then with spacewalking and training for spacewalks. [Part of the astronauts' training is at the Neutral Buoyancy Lab near the Johnson Space Center in Texas, which is essentially a giant swimming pool.] When they're in the neutral buoyancy lab they're in a suit that's pretty similar to the suit that they'd wear in space, but obviously there's some changes made since you're in water. And that's the best analog we have ... astronauts can have a situation in which they have a different experience when they're actually in space than they do when they're in the pool. And so Ann (McClain) had trained in both a medium- and a large-torso spacesuit and thought that she was fine in either one. But when she actually got out in space wearing a spacesuit -- she was wearing a medium last Friday -- then she ... really felt like that she should still be in a medium for future spacewalks. A large would be too big. Dean : We have two medium hard upper torsos in space, two larges and two extra larges. However, one of the mediums and one of the extra larges are spares that would require additional time for configuration. Schierholz: You don't want the astronauts fighting against their spacesuit ... because it's already a physically demanding task to put them in a spacesuit and have them do work in it. And the suit itself is pressurized when they're in space, so they're already to some degree fighting against the spacesuit. You want it to be as optimally fitted as possible. So the feedback from Anne was that she felt she should really be in a medium suit. There's another medium torso but it's not currently configured into a spacesuit. So it's easier to swap out the spacewalkers than to swap out parts of the spacesuit. It also helps them keep the schedule. If they reconfigure the suit, that would take significantly more time. They wouldn't be able to do the spacewalk by Friday. And they want to do the spacewalk Friday because they have another spacewalk coming up April 8 and then there's a rocket launch that's bringing cargo to the space station on April 17. So they have all of these things sort of lining up that are keeping them busy. Yeah, I can imagine. Schierholz: It's like if you have to reschedule an appointment, right? And you're like, 'Oh crap, where did that go? It doesn't fit in the schedule anymore.' We all can relate to that. Schierholz: (Laughs) How much does the body change in microgravity? Schierholz: Most astronauts will gain up to two inches in length when their spine elongates. But it's different for every astronaut. And it's completely based on the lack of gravity, so the minute that they get back into a gravity environment they go back to a more compressed spine. And some astronauts report that they know that they're longer but they don't really feel any difference and others report, you know, they feel different as a result. Tell me more about the spacesuits. Schierholz: I'm pretty sure that they're the spacesuits we had for the shuttle program, too. I know that they're suits we've had a long time. And there aren't a lot of them and that they were made to be modular so that you can configure them to be the right shape and size for as many astronauts as possible. Anything you'd like to add before I let you go? Schierholz: I think it's just inevitable that there will be an all-female spacewalk. It just won't be this Friday.

That's since the department was created in 1979,\" said Democratic Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, who chairs the Appropriations Committee's Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies Subcommittee, at a hearing on DeVos' proposed 2020 budget. \"Madam Secretary, I have to say, and maybe it's offensive: Shame on you,\" DeLauro said. Overall, DeVos proposed a 12% decrease in funding for her department for fiscal year 2020. Read More Lawmakers have rejected the Trump administration's previous efforts, increasing the Education Department budget instead, even when Republicans controlled both the Senate and House. Even though the secretary's budget has even less of a chance of being adopted this year, it lays out a set of priorities for the administration -- and gives advocacy groups plenty to complain about. Trump rollbacks leave more than 100,000 people waiting on student loan relief One proposal that has repeatedly gotten attention from lawmakers is DeVos' suggestion to cut funding from Special Olympic events at schools. \"We had to make some difficult decisions with this budget,\" DeVos responded when asked about the proposal by Rep. Mark Pocan, a Wisconsin Democrat, who said that more than 270,000 children benefit from those programs. \"I think the Special Olympics is an awesome organization, one that is supported by the philanthropic sector as well,\" she said. DeVos has personally supported the group. After proposing to cut the funding in her first budget, she announced that she would donate part of her salary to the organization. A spokeswoman confirmed Tuesday that the secretary made the donation last year and added that DeVos is \"personally supportive of Special Olympics and its mission.\" The proposed budget maintains the same level of funding for core special education programs, including grants to states under the department's Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The secretary was also criticized at Tuesday's hearing for eliminating money for the 21st Century Community Learning Center, which supports after-school and summer programs for students, particularly those who come from low-income families or attend low-performing schools. \"This year, I'm puzzled. You're trying to cut it again, completely ignoring the strong evidence that parents support this program and in fact want more of it,\" said Rep. Nita Lowey, a New York Democrat who's the chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee. DeVos wants to cut budget funding for student loan forgiveness, again Republican ranking member Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma commended DeVos for several aspects of her budget, including support for charter schools and for science, technology, math and engineering (STEM) programs, as well as expanding the Pell Grant program to students enrolled in short-term certificate programs. But he called some of the proposed reductions \"shortsighted,\" including those to the federal TRIO programs , which provide support to students from disadvantaged backgrounds. The secretary's budget requests new funds for K-12 school choice tax credits, called Education Freedom Scholarships. They could be used for both private and public schools. The agency is asking the Treasury Department for $5 billion a year for the new program.

A person by that same name testified before the Canadian Senate in 2016 criticizing the Kim regime. CNN's attempts to reach Hong for comment were unsuccessful. Spanish authorities had kept the case under wraps until Tuesday , when Judge Jos\u00e9 de la Mata ordered court documents unsealed. According to those court documents, Hong -- a Mexican national and US resident -- was the one who led the assault.

The group said it was responding to an \"urgent situation\" and was \"invited into the embassy.\" CCD denied it had used any violence. The Cheollima Civil Defense first gained international recognition after it reportedly provided refuge for Kim Han Sol, the son of Kim Jong Nam.

Lawyer Lee Wolosky, who represents the group, said there \"there are a number of statements attributed to the Judge in media reports that do not accurately reflect what happened in Madrid.\" \"It was, in any event, highly irresponsible to disclose publicly the names of people who are working in opposition to a brutal regime that routinely and summarily executes its enemies,\" Wolosky said in a statement to CNN. \"The Spanish judge purported to reach conclusions without any input from representatives of Free Joseon,\" Wolosky said, using another name that CCD goes by. A view of North Korea's embassy in Madrid on Thursday, February 28. The Cheollima Civil Defense said in its statement that revealing the identity of its members could put them in danger. The group accused US government sources of leaking their role in the raid to the media, and thereby committing \"abhorrent acts pursued in the name of political expediency, in service to a regime who has tortured and killed millions.\" \"Some of us will be imprisoned, tortured or killed in the course of this fight. But to share information that may help identify any of us who take risks to protect others is to aid and abet the regime in Pyongyang,\" the statement read. Hong is a known commodity among the close-knit group of activists, journalists and academics who cover human rights in North Korea. As a college student, Hong helped found Liberty in North Korea, an NGO that has helped hundreds of North Koreans defect. However, Hong has \"had no involvement with the organization for over ten years,\" Hannah Song, the organization's current CEO, said in a statement. \"We have no knowledge of his recent activities, and we have no information on the Madrid Embassy incident other than what has been published by the media.\" In recent public appearances, Hong has been identified as president of the Joseon Institute, a think tank studying \"increasingly imminent, dramatic change\" in North Korea. Jean Lee, a North Korea expert at the Wilson Center, said she remembers Hong from speaking on a panel with him in 2012. \"He's a very intense guy and very committed to North Korea and very dogmatic,\" Lee said. \"He comes up in conversation on a regular basis in that circle.\" Lee, who as a reporter for The Associated Press opened the company's bureau in Pyongyang, told CNN she had no knowledge of Hong's involvement with the group before media reports first surfaced, but said she long suspected that the person behind the mysterious group was not a native Korean speaker. Lee said that English versions of their announcements were grammatically sound but they usually seemed stilted in Korean, as if they were translated verbatim. The group also used a distinctly South Korean spelling of Cheollima, Lee said.

Director Tim Burton seemed like an unorthodox choice for the assignment, but the lead entry in this year's Disney adaptation parade sets the bar nearly as high as an elephant's eye for \" Aladdin \" and \" The Lion King .\"\nAlthough the original 1941 film is rightfully beloved, parts of it haven't aged well, and the story's slim nature -- coupled with the near-absence of significant human characters -- created formidable hurdles with which something like \"Beauty and the Beast\" didn't have to contend. So give credit to Burton and screenwriter Ehren Kruger for basically knitting together this \"Dumbo\" with only a rudimentary connection to the source, while incorporating a relevant message about the natural world and circuses that provides timely underpinnings to this otherwise fanciful tale. Set exactly 100 years ago during the heyday of circuses, the movie has a foot in World War I. Veteran Holt Farrier (Colin Farrell) returns to his two children (Nico Parker, Finley Hobbins), who have lost their mother while their dad was losing an arm in Europe. A circus rider, Holt is ready to rejoin the big top, but the circus' colorful proprietor Max Medici (Danny DeVito) has other plans, wanting him to work with the pregnant elephant he has just acquired. Read More The baby soon arrives, but he's not the cute little attraction that Medici had in mind. Instead, his massive ears make him an object of derision -- at least, until he surprises the two kids by Inhaling a feather and promptly blasting himself into the air. Where the circus reveal about Dumbo's flying abilities was basically the big finish to the original, here, it's just the beginning of the little elephant's journey. Again separated from his protective mother, he becomes a much-pursued prize, with Medici approached by a sleazy circus impresario played by Michael Keaton, who, along with Burton and DeVito, joins an unlikely \"Batman Returns\" reunion. Although positioned as a family movie, \"Dumbo\" has some deeper thoughts beneath those over-sized ears. Beyond the animal-rights undercurrent, there's a not-so-subtle warning about corporate greed run amok, which might seem like a slightly awkward juxtaposition with Disney's obvious desire to translate the adorable elephant into shelves full of plush toys. Even so, while Dumbo is plenty adorable with those big, soulful eyes, there are no talking animals here. That means grounding the story and emotion not only in the little elephant's plight but those of the human characters, which includes the kids dealing with their own parental issues. Fortunately, Burton has orchestrated a dense and intricate world, with the colorful circus denizens and design bringing to mind Robert Altman's \"Popeye.\" Composer Danny Elfman, meanwhile, delivers his latest lush score in the service of a Burton movie, which also features an updated rendition of the song \"Baby Mine.\" Purists can quibble, of course, about the need to mine the Disney vaults in this manner, but doing so ignores the prevailing tides in an entertainment industry built around exploiting established intellectual property. Allowing that movies like \"Dumbo\" are inevitable, this feels like a genuine overachiever -- a film that doesn't always soar but flies higher, and more gracefully, than it honestly had any right to given the level of difficulty involved. \"Dumbo\" premieres March 29 in the US.

Quirky, droll and surprisingly dry given its preoccupation with drinking, the show serves up an amusing riff on vampire lore, and as a bonus, living in Staten Island.\nThe rather simple premise involves a quartet of vampires -- hundreds of years old -- who have improbably settled in Staten Island, where they share a house. Like any roommates, there are some issues, although when one gripes about finding people \"half drunk\" in the house, it takes on a very different meaning. Nandor (Kayvan Novak), the lead vampire, also has a human attendant to safeguard him during the day, or \"Vampire's familiar,\" a relationship described as \"like being a best friend ... who's also a slave.\" Said aide, Guillermo (Harvey Guillen), dreams of becoming a vampire himself, but for now endures the indignities of servitude, which includes having to hang out with other familiars when vampires assemble. The other bloodsuckers, Laszlo (Matt Berry) and Nadja (Natasia Demetriou), operate as a kind of team, albeit a squabbling one. Finally, there's Colin (Mark Proksch), a \"psychic vampire,\" who doesn't drink people but rather drains their energy, hilariously, by boring them with his mind-numbing dullness. Produced by Jemaine Clement (half of \"Flight of the Conchords\"), director Taika Waititi and Paul Simms (FX's \"Atlanta\"), the series employs a documentary-style format that has the vampires delivering direct-to-camera testimonials. It's not the most novel device but nevertheless works. (The undead cast no reflection, but it turns out they photograph just fine, if a little pale.) Read More Perhaps foremost, the show is unpretentious in its just plain silliness, which in later episodes includes a turf war with werewolves, the challenge of finding virgins to feast upon for a special occasion and an encounter with the vampire (guest Nick Kroll) who lords over Manhattan and is, naturally, a bit of an imperious snob. The dark streak running through FX's dramas has translated into a fairly bleak brand of comedy, yielding several shows which are very good (see the aforementioned \"Atlanta\") but few that are laugh-out-loud funny. \"What We Do in the Shadows\" might be a strange title for a show whose main attribute is its lightness, but in its small way, it offers an antidote to that, while demonstrating that there's room for a fresh spin on funny monsters. And it's probably even better if you're half-drunk. \"What We Do in the Shadows\" premieres March 27 at 10 p.m. on FX.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kayvan novak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guillermo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nandor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvey guillen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "staten island", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-03-27T18:29:50.090+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fe2a0d3057cc554b5fc7cde4fb10684f0dd49378", "url": "http://us.cnn.com/2019/03/27/uk/britain-brexit-journey-gbr-intl/index.html", "site_full": "us.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://us.cnn.com/world", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "World news \u2013 breaking news, videos and headlines - CNN", "title": "Can Theresa May secure a Brexit deal without offering her resignation?", "title_full": "Can Theresa May secure a Brexit deal without offering her resignation? - CNN", "published": "2019-03-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190325180823-house-of-commons-brexit-0325-screengrab-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fe2a0d3057cc554b5fc7cde4fb10684f0dd49378", "url": "http://us.cnn.com/2019/03/27/uk/britain-brexit-journey-gbr-intl/index.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jane Merrick, for CNN", "published": "2019-03-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Can Theresa May secure a Brexit deal without offering her resignation?", "text": "London (CNN) Britain's Brexit journey has been plagued by uncertainty -- but on Wednesday we might get the answer to these two questions: Firstly, can Prime Minister Theresa May put her deal and the stability of the country ahead of her political career and pledge to step down as leader to secure those two things? Secondly, can the UK Parliament find an alternative plan to help Britain leave the EU under different terms?\nOn the first, as part of a political plea bargain, Conservative Brexiteers will this evening urge the Prime Minister to set a timetable for her departure from Downing Street in exchange for their votes. May has so far insisted she will not announce her resignation -- a position in keeping with her steadfastness and, at times, intransigence in office. But should May decide to hint at her resignation, she could gain majority support in Parliament for her Brexit plan, nearly five months after it was agreed with Brussels and after weeks of argument and successive defeats. Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May leaves 10 Downing Street in London on March 25, 2019. Parliament's next move Read More Some prominent Conservative Brexit supporters have indicated they will back May's deal when it eventually returns to Parliament for the third time. But, they argue, more will support her plan if she announces her resignation. If the Prime Minister refuses, the battle of wills between May and her own Members of Parliament (MPs) will continue to rage. This will make it less likely that her Brexit plan is passed by Parliament. Which brings us to the second question: what will Parliament do next? This afternoon, lawmakers from all parties will debate a menu of alternative Brexit plans -- including a hard, no-deal Brexit, a softer deal that would keep the UK in a single market with Europe and even canceling the departure from the EU. While this will not offer a Plan B for Brexit today -- MPs will learn, over a series of indicative votes, which alternative has the most support. A firmer result will emerge in a second round of voting next Monday. It is possible, of course, that there is no consensus for any alternative plan and the concept of lawmakers taking control of Brexit from the Prime Minister -- triggered by a vote earlier this week -- will have failed. But MPs at least finally have a chance to try to make it work. JUST WATCHED May puts the pressure on lawmakers in Brexit address Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH\nMay puts the pressure on lawmakers in Brexit address 02:59 Not legally binding? Paradoxically, it would suit May for a softer Brexit to emerge as the favorite among lawmakers. That's because her allies believe it will focus the minds of Conservatives -- and the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), whose votes the government relies on for a working majority -- who refuse to back her deal. They will be presented with a clear choice: Support the Prime Minister's plan or risk losing their dream of autonomy from Brussels by facing a soft Brexit. It is not clear whether any alternative plan would be implemented by the Prime Minister, despite lawmakers seizing control of the Brexit process through Parliament. Her aides say she does not need to accept an alternative because the votes are only indicative -- and not legally binding. However, the UK government's top law officer, the Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, told the Cabinet last night, according to CNN affiliate ITV News , that the government would be obliged to accept whatever alternative was produced from the indicative vote process. Downing Street and the Attorney General's office both declined to comment to CNN on the report. Separately, today is the last chance for Conservative Brexiteers to try to force the country to leave the EU this Friday, March 29 -- the date when Brexit was originally supposed to take place. Last week, Brussels approved a two-speed extension to Brexit -- to either April 12 or May 22 -- to give May time to get her deal through or come up with an alternative. After the indicative voting Wednesday, the government will put forward a motion to confirm that proposed extension.

In his eyes, a good Haka can lead to a better performance on the pitch. \"There are definite correlations,\" says Crawford, \"but also there are some definite benefits within our culture that can add and enhance what is a high-performance environment. \"That excites me greatly to think that our people and our custom actually have value in high performance.\" Like a well-drilled rugby team, Crawford adds that the Haka requires precision: \"Your eyes -- are they in the correct position?

If the Haka is, after all, a challenge, then meeting and accepting that challenge is part of the battle. In 2008, a face-off between Wales and New Zealand lasted 90 seconds after All Blacks players had finished the Haka. It took much persuasion and whistle blowing from referee Jonathan Kaplan to separate the two teams and get the game under way. At the 2007 and 2011 World Cups, French players linked arms and edged towards the New Zealand team while the Haka was being performed. The two sides ended inches away from each other. Meanwhile, in 1996 an Australian team chose to ignore the Haka altogether, instead carrying out warm drills deep in their own half.

It is unclear when she will issue a ruling. Nathan i s tasked with weighing the SEC's request that Musk be held in contempt for violating a settlement agreement reached last year, which required he get pre-approval for social media posts about the electric car company. Musk tweeted on February 19 that \"Tesla made 0 cars in 2011, but will make around 500k in 2019.\" Hours later, he posted a follow-up tweet indicating that the company will actually deliver just 400,000 cars this year. Why Tesla needs Elon Musk Although Musk corrected his mistake, regulators said he had \"once again published inaccurate and material information about Tesla to his over 24 million Twitter followers,\" according to court papers. Read More The SEC sued Musk last month , arguing that he had breached a deal struck last October that mandates he receive pre-approval of any posts with information that's \"material\" to shareholders. Tesla agreed to establish a board committee to oversee those posts. In a court filing, Tesla conceded Musk did not receive pre-approval from anyone on that committee for his February posts, but the company has since claimed that he didn't need it. Musk maintains he has diligently tried to follow the court settlement, and that the SEC's request is a breach of his constitutional right to free speech. The battle between Musk and the SEC goes back to August 2018, when Musk tweeted that he had secured funding to take Tesla private at $420 a share. Tesla's stock soared after his announcement. However, Musk hadn't secured the funding, according to the SEC, and in September the regulator filed a lawsuit saying he misled investors. Tesla and Musk were each fined $20 million as part of the settlement and Musk was forced to step down as Tesla's chairman. He's remained Tesla's CEO. If Musk is found guilty of contempt, legal experts say he could face a fine, further limits to his social media use and his removal as Tesla CEO. Nathan could also toss out the settlement with the SEC, effectively reopening the agency's litigation against Musk and Tesla.

Quirky, droll and surprisingly dry given its preoccupation with drinking, the show serves up an amusing riff on vampire lore, and as a bonus, living in Staten Island.\nThe rather simple premise involves a quartet of vampires -- hundreds of years old -- who have improbably settled in Staten Island, where they share a house. Like any roommates, there are some issues, although when one gripes about finding people \"half drunk\" in the house, it takes on a very different meaning. Nandor (Kayvan Novak), the lead vampire, also has a human attendant to safeguard him during the day, or \"Vampire's familiar,\" a relationship described as \"like being a best friend ... who's also a slave.\" Said aide, Guillermo (Harvey Guillen), dreams of becoming a vampire himself, but for now endures the indignities of servitude, which includes having to hang out with other familiars when vampires assemble. The other bloodsuckers, Laszlo (Matt Berry) and Nadja (Natasia Demetriou), operate as a kind of team, albeit a squabbling one. Finally, there's Colin (Mark Proksch), a \"psychic vampire,\" who doesn't drink people but rather drains their energy, hilariously, by boring them with his mind-numbing dullness. Produced by Jemaine Clement (half of \"Flight of the Conchords\"), director Taika Waititi and Paul Simms (FX's \"Atlanta\"), the series employs a documentary-style format that has the vampires delivering direct-to-camera testimonials. It's not the most novel device but nevertheless works. (The undead cast no reflection, but it turns out they photograph just fine, if a little pale.) Read More Perhaps foremost, the show is unpretentious in its just plain silliness, which in later episodes includes a turf war with werewolves, the challenge of finding virgins to feast upon for a special occasion and an encounter with the vampire (guest Nick Kroll) who lords over Manhattan and is, naturally, a bit of an imperious snob. The dark streak running through FX's dramas has translated into a fairly bleak brand of comedy, yielding several shows which are very good (see the aforementioned \"Atlanta\") but few that are laugh-out-loud funny. \"What We Do in the Shadows\" might be a strange title for a show whose main attribute is its lightness, but in its small way, it offers an antidote to that, while demonstrating that there's room for a fresh spin on funny monsters. And it's probably even better if you're half-drunk. \"What We Do in the Shadows\" premieres March 27 at 10 p.m. on FX.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kayvan novak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guillermo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nandor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvey guillen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "staten island", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-03-27T18:58:56.037+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f6dce7fe1b3ebb2912eea88d8a687a7bfa49a1af", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/27/politics/stacey-abrams-joe-biden-meeting-vice-president-2020-cbs-interview/index.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rss%2Fcnn_latest+%28RSS%3A+CNN+-+Most+Recent%29", "site_full": "edition.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_latest.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "Stacey Abrams says the vice presidency 'was not the core issue' discussed with Joe Biden - CNNPolitics", "title_full": "Stacey Abrams says the vice presidency 'was not the core issue' discussed with Joe Biden - CNNPolitics", "published": "2019-03-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190321115607-joe-biden-stacey-abrams-split-0321-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f3161b091cc94f19c84e2bbdd4291cf8d463b786", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/27/politics/stacey-abrams-joe-biden-meeting-vice-president-2020-cbs-interview/index.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "David Wright", "published": "2019-03-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Stacey Abrams says the vice presidency 'was not the core issue' discussed with Joe Biden - CNNPolitics", "text": "(CNN) Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams said Wednesday that \"you don't run for second place\" when asked about the possibility of being Joe Biden's running mate during the 2020 Democratic primary, saying that she is \"open to a number of options right now.\"\nIn an interview on \"The View,\" Abrams explained that \"if I'm going to enter a primary, then I'm going to enter a primary.

Biden requested the meeting with Abrams, according to a person familiar with the sit-down, as the two consider their own respective political futures. As he prepares for a possible run, one subject of discussion has been the early selection of a running mate, which one aide said would help keep the focus of the primary fight on the ultimate goal of unseating Trump. A person familiar with the meeting said Biden and Abrams discussed a variety of topics on policy and politics, including whether she intends to run for Senate next year. The vice presidency was not formally discussed during their meeting, two people familiar with the meeting tell CNN. On both \"The View\" and CBS, Abrams was also asked about increasing scrutiny of Biden's record as he mulls a run for president -- in particular, his handling of the Anita Hill hearings nearly 30 years ago while chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and his past positions on school desegregation. \"Here's what I would say,\" Abrams replied on CBS. \"In my book, 'Lead from the Outside,' I talk about the fact that we make mistakes based on the information we have at the time. And one of our responsibilities is to create space for people to understand that mistakes happen, and that you can grow.\" Abrams continued, \"What I hope anyone running for president will do is acknowledge mistakes made, talk about what you've learned, and then apply those new lessons to how you intend to lead.\" On \"The View,\" Abrams elaborated, saying that \"we have to remember apologies aren't for the person who committed an offense. They're for the recipient and the measure should be do people feel their values have been heard and that you are truly repentant... This is true for everyone running. We will make apologies because we're asking people to trust us. People cannot trust you if they don't know that you know who you are and what you've done. But once you've admitted and you've offered atonement, then we should move onto the next phase.\" She continued, \"I think he has begun the process. But this is going to be a long primary and there are going to be a lot of questions. And I think he's tough enough to take it.\" Abrams was also asked if \"this is the year,\" with a historically diverse Democratic presidential field, that a woman or minority ends up being the presidential nominee. \"I believe so,\" she said. \"For me, the conversation that led to me writing 'Lead from the Outside' is that we have to start evolving what the face of leadership looks like.\" On CBS, Abrams also pointed out that she's \"having lunch and coffee and drinks and water with everyone running for president who is willing to talk to me,\" prompting a discussion of her own future plans. In addition to Biden, Abrams has held meetings with Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Kamala Harris of California, as well as former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper. She spoke to South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg on the phone. \"When you drink alone, are you having drinks with somebody who is thinking about running for president?\" CBS This Morning co-anchor John Dickerson asked. \"Yes, we have sipped English breakfast tea together in the morning,\" Abrams joked. She continued, \"I am deeply appreciative of those who have encouraged me to run for a variety of offices. I will say the presidency wasn't top of mind to begin with, but I think that the success I had in our election, transforming the electorate, the work I've done as a business leader, as a civic leader, and as a political leader, positions me to be just as capable of becoming the president of the United States as anyone running. My responsibility, though, is to make sure I'm running for the right reasons and at the right time.

Director Tim Burton seemed like an unorthodox choice for the assignment, but the lead entry in this year's Disney adaptation parade sets the bar nearly as high as an elephant's eye for \" Aladdin \" and \" The Lion King .\"\nAlthough the original 1941 film is rightfully beloved, parts of it haven't aged well, and the story's slim nature -- coupled with the near-absence of significant human characters -- created formidable hurdles with which something like \"Beauty and the Beast\" didn't have to contend. So give credit to Burton and screenwriter Ehren Kruger for basically knitting together this \"Dumbo\" with only a rudimentary connection to the source, while incorporating a relevant message about the natural world and circuses that provides timely underpinnings to this otherwise fanciful tale. Set exactly 100 years ago during the heyday of circuses, the movie has a foot in World War I. Veteran Holt Farrier (Colin Farrell) returns to his two children (Nico Parker, Finley Hobbins), who have lost their mother while their dad was losing an arm in Europe. A circus rider, Holt is ready to rejoin the big top, but the circus' colorful proprietor Max Medici (Danny DeVito) has other plans, wanting him to work with the pregnant elephant he has just acquired. Read More The baby soon arrives, but he's not the cute little attraction that Medici had in mind. Instead, his massive ears make him an object of derision -- at least, until he surprises the two kids by Inhaling a feather and promptly blasting himself into the air. Where the circus reveal about Dumbo's flying abilities was basically the big finish to the original, here, it's just the beginning of the little elephant's journey. Again separated from his protective mother, he becomes a much-pursued prize, with Medici approached by a sleazy circus impresario played by Michael Keaton, who, along with Burton and DeVito, joins an unlikely \"Batman Returns\" reunion. Although positioned as a family movie, \"Dumbo\" has some deeper thoughts beneath those over-sized ears. Beyond the animal-rights undercurrent, there's a not-so-subtle warning about corporate greed run amok, which might seem like a slightly awkward juxtaposition with Disney's obvious desire to translate the adorable elephant into shelves full of plush toys. Even so, while Dumbo is plenty adorable with those big, soulful eyes, there are no talking animals here. That means grounding the story and emotion not only in the little elephant's plight but those of the human characters, which includes the kids dealing with their own parental issues. Fortunately, Burton has orchestrated a dense and intricate world, with the colorful circus denizens and design bringing to mind Robert Altman's \"Popeye.\" Composer Danny Elfman, meanwhile, delivers his latest lush score in the service of a Burton movie, which also features an updated rendition of the song \"Baby Mine.\" Purists can quibble, of course, about the need to mine the Disney vaults in this manner, but doing so ignores the prevailing tides in an entertainment industry built around exploiting established intellectual property. Allowing that movies like \"Dumbo\" are inevitable, this feels like a genuine overachiever -- a film that doesn't always soar but flies higher, and more gracefully, than it honestly had any right to given the level of difficulty involved. \"Dumbo\" premieres March 29 in the US.

Southwest said the number of seats it has to sell this quarter will be much lower than it previously expected because it isn't flying as many planes. It said 2,800 of the cancellations were because of the Boeing ( BA ) 737 Max grounding. The airline also disclosed that has cut back on the number of flights through April 20 in anticipation of a continued grounding of its 737 Max planes. Southwest also said it will lose a total of 2,800 flights during the quarter because of \"unscheduled maintenance disruptions arising from contract negotiations \" with its mechanics union. The union has disputed the airline's claim that members are calling off sick or ordering extra work to put pressure on management during labor talks. Read More The company said it also lost 3,400 flights because of worse-than-expected weather during the quarter. It had previously said softness in passenger bookings because of the government shutdown would cost it $60 million during the quarter. It said the latest problems with 737 Max grounding, the maintenance issues and weather would cost it an additional $150 million during the quarter that ends on Sunday. Southwest's ( LUV ) stock was more than 1% lower in premarket trading. Southwest has more of the 737 Max planes than any other US airline. American and United Airlines ( UAL ) also have the planes in their fleets. On Sunday American Airlines ( AAL ) , the world's largest airline, announced it was canceling flights through April 24. The planes were grounded on March 13 , following two fatal crashes in a little more than five months. Although Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration said they are working on a software fix for the automatic safety feature that is the focus of those crash investigations, the global grounding of the jets is for an indefinite period of time. Southwest flies nothing but 737 jets, 34 of which are 737 Max jets. It has not indicated any plan to cancel or change its 737 Max orders with Boeing.

The third in a recent spate of suicides connected to school massacres, Richman's death is doubly horrific because since his daughter's death, he had devoted his life to preventing tragedies like Sandy Hook through a foundation he founded and named after her.\nDavid J. Morris Few subjects defeat the scientific mind like the subject of suicide. Because researchers cannot interview the dead, we can never really know why someone takes this path. It confounds researchers, defies typical human logic and delivers laser-focused pain to a victim's friends and family. And it's hard to see any sign of progress. According to 2016 data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , suicide is now the second-leading cause of death among people between the ages of 10 and 34 and the fourth leading cause of death among people between 35 and 54. In the United States, a country obsessed with gun violence and murder, there were twice as many suicides as homicides. On a certain level, understanding suicide is more of a spiritual question than a medical one. As Albert Camus put it in \"The Myth of Sisyphus,\" \"Judging whether life is or is not worth living amounts to answering the fundamental question of philosophy.\" The truth of the matter is that nearly all suicides cause more pain than they prevent, and research indicates that one suicide can breed others . For this reason, more than one researcher has compared suicide to a contagion. The waves of the event ripple ever outward, like a stone dropped into a still pond. As one mother whose son took his own life told journalist Andrew Solomon , \"I feel as though my fingers are caught in a slamming door and I've been stopped permanently midscream.\" JUST WATCHED Parkland school shooting survivor dies by suicide Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH\nParkland school shooting survivor dies by suicide 00:29 Public accounts of suicide also help inspire suicidal behavior and elicit suicidal thoughts. Whenever a major suicide story breaks in the media, the suicide rate goes up. After Marilyn Monroe's death, which was reported widely as a suicide, the rate of suicide went up 12%. After Anthony Bourdain and Kate Spade took their own lives in 2018, the number of calls to suicide hotlines across the US spiked by 65% . Read More One of the few things we can say with any certainty is that people have been killing themselves for a very long time and that most religions are opposed to it. The ancient Greeks looked at life as a gift from the gods. In Athens those who killed themselves were denied funeral rites and the hand that had been used to commit the act was severed from the arm. From its earliest days, the Catholic Church opposed suicide. St. Augustine, in his argument against it, said that suicide violated the Sixth Commandment: \"Thou shall not murder.\" Dante took matters a few steps further in \"The Inferno,\" where those who killed themselves were condemned to live in the Seventh Circle of Hell as bleeding trees while being tortured by harpies. Despite all the official prohibitions against it, suicide has remained a constant throughout human history. Achilles, the hero of \"The Iliad,\" when he saw the dead body of Patroclus, his friend and second-in-command, had to be restrained by a fellow soldier, lest he cut his own throat. The impulse to harm oneself after trauma or the death of a loved one seems to be rooted deep in human psychology. Nor is the phenomenon of suicidal behavior as an expression of grief limited to Western society. As anthropologist Jack Goody noted in his 1962 study of the West African LoDagaa tribe, the hands of mourners were tied together with an animal hide as a precaution against self-harm after a death in the family occurred.

MUST WATCH\nParkland victim's dad reads suicide prevention questions 02:34 We will never know what prompted Richman, Sydney Aiello or another unnamed Parkland student to take their own lives. It's tempting to offer some hollow version of \"thoughts and prayers\" for people who have lost family members to suicide, but as a society we need challenge ourselves to think more creatively about what to do about it. Suicide is a kind of social epidemic seemingly exacerbated by the media and technology we binge on every day. We are spending more and more time looking at our phones and less and less time actually interacting with other human beings who might offer us an outlet to help relieve our suffering. We are spending more and more time online every day \"connecting\" with others on social media, but we've never been more socially isolated or possessed less self-knowledge. As Jaron Lanier writes in \"You Are Not A Gadget,\" his 2010 study of internet culture , \"You have to be somebody before you can share yourself.\" There are other tangible steps we can take as well. In the US, as one might expect, guns and drugs are among the most common methods of suicide. The Veterans Administration -- which is dealing with a suicide epidemic that sees an average of 20 veterans taking their lives every day -- has a longstanding policy of asking veterans undergoing treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder if they can lock up or remove any firearms in their homes in order to prevent them from killing themselves. How we talk about Kate Spade could help others survive While I don't expect to solve the gun control debate with this logic, research shows that impulsivity plays a huge role in suicide, so denying high-risk people access to firearms and dangerous drugs such as opiates could save lives. The most important thing, however, is to stop repeating the platitudes and start having a more honest and blunt conversation about suicide. Many survivors will be haunted forever by the question which lingers -- \"Why didn't he reach out for help?\" Suicide is so many things -- an act of desperation, a way of ending one's pain, a kind of mass murder and a kind of mirror held up to our world, a world that many such as Jeremy Richman found unbearable.

In a statement Tuesday, Roma advocacy group La Voix des Rroms said the racist stereotype of a Roma child-thief has been around in France since the Middle Ages. The group likened anti-Roma aggression to the massacre of the Rohingya in Myanmar, and called on people to form citizen protection groups to guard those whose lives are in danger. CNN has contacted the group for further comment. More violence took place on Monday in Bobigny and Clichy-sous-Bois, disadvantaged suburbs northeast of Paris, the source told AFP. There were no reports of injuries in that unrest. The agency said the rumors appeared to originate from Facebook and Snapchat. The attacks are \"unacceptable,\" AFP reported government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux as saying. The incidents provided further evidence of \"the absolute need to fight 'fake news,'\" he added. \"Spreading such rumors in a highly organized and viral way on social media results in violence (and) the stigmatization of a community,\" he said. WhatsApp has been linked to lynchings in India. Facebook is trying to contain the crisis In December, police in Versailles, 12 miles south of Paris, tweeted about the punishment for posting false rumors online. Under French law, you can be fined \u20ac45,000 to \u20ac135,000 ($51,000 to $153,000) for circulating fake news on the internet. The spread of rumors and fake news on social media is a growing problem worldwide. In July 2018, a spate of lynchings was triggered in India by rumors shared on the WhatsApp messaging service. Over six weeks, nearly a dozen people were killed in separate incidents after being falsely accused of child abduction based on WhatsApp rumors.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://t.co/FRWPZnpakP", "https://twitter.com/prefpolice/status/1110518853879193600", "https://twitter.com/prefpolice/status/1110518853879193600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.facebook.com/lavoixdesrroms/photos/a.1577477969176504/2329830497274577/?type=3&theater", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/FakeNews?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://t.co/gQVz6wLNcZ", "https://twitter.com/PoliceNat78000/status/1074684933531152385", "https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "https://twitter.com/prefpolice/status/1110133407756046336", "https://twitter.com/prefpolice/status/1110133407756046336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "roma", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "afp", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nanterre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-03-27T19:24:08.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "959fd649d8f0a7b54ba4865332f2e27b9df1aa82", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/27/politics/mueller-grand-jury-investigation/index.html?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter", "site_full": "edition.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Grand jury investigation started by Robert Mueller 'continuing robustly,' prosecutor says - CNNPolitics", "title_full": "Grand jury investigation started by Robert Mueller 'continuing robustly,' prosecutor says - CNNPolitics", "published": "2019-03-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.004, "main_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190324144408-08-russia-investigation-0324-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "959fd649d8f0a7b54ba4865332f2e27b9df1aa82", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/27/politics/mueller-grand-jury-investigation/index.html?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Katelyn Polantz", "published": "2019-03-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Grand jury investigation started by Robert Mueller 'continuing robustly,' prosecutor says - CNNPolitics", "text": "Washington (CNN) The grand jury's criminal investigation started by special counsel investigators is \"continuing robustly,\" a federal prosecutor said Wednesday, even though Robert Mueller filed his report on Russian interference in the 2016 election with the Justice Department last week.\nIn a federal court hearing about whether the name of the company and country that's been fighting a subpoena from Mueller since last summer should be revealed, Chief Judge Beryl Howell asked prosecutor David Goodhand, point-blank, if the grand jury investigation is over. \"No, it's continuing.

Nitrogen oxides, including nitrogen dioxide, are tailpipe pollutants, entering the air due to burning fuel.\nCannabis-related ER visits in Colorado jump threefold after legalization, study says \"One of the most consistent findings over the past few decades has been a link between cities and psychosis,\" Joanne Newbury , lead author of the study and a postdoctoral researcher at King's College London, said Tuesday. \"Children who are born and raised in urban versus rural settings are almost twice as likely to develop psychosis in adulthood.\" An association but not a cause-effect relationship For the study, published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, Newbury and her co-authors explored whether psychotic experiences are more common among teens exposed to higher levels of air pollution. They used data from a study with more than 2,000 participants, all born in England and Wales in 1994 and 1995. Researchers have followed up with each child repeatedly at ages 5, 7, 10, 12 and most recently at 18, Newbury explained. They were asked in a private interview, \"Have you ever heard voices that other people cannot hear? Have you thought you were being followed or spied on?\" Daily or high-potency cannabis increases risk of psychotic disorder, study finds Read More Dr. Helen Fisher, a study co-author and a reader of developmental psychopathology at King's College London, said Tuesday that \"when we talk about psychotic experiences, we are talking about people who are experiencing things like hearing or seeing things other people don't or feeling very paranoid.\" Such symptoms -- which \"are actually quite common in the general population,\" she said -- are considered \"to be a kind of milder or less extreme form of the kind of psychotic symptom like hallucinations or delusions that we see in people who experience psychotic disorders like schizophrenia.\" A total of 623 (or 30%) of the teens reported at least one psychotic experience between ages 12 and 18. Next, the researchers gathered hourly emissions data from monitoring sites to assess pollution levels in the places where each teen spent the most time: a home address and two other places such as school. Young people on amphetamines for ADHD have twice the psychosis risk compared to other stimulants, study says Psychotic experiences were significantly more common among teens in the highest quartile of pollution exposure, even after the researchers accounted for factors that might also be linked to psychosis, such as cigarette smoking, cannabis dependence and neighborhood crime levels. The teens exposed to top-quartile levels of nitrogen dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter ( PM2.5 , fine inhalable particles derived from chemical smoke) had 71%, 72% and 45% greater odds, respectively, of psychotic experiences compared with those exposed to the lowest-quartile levels. \"Odds gradually increase as you move from rural to suburb to urban settings,\" Newbury said, with teens living in the \"most urban settings\" having \"94% greater odds of psychotic experiences compared to those living in rural settings.\" Newbury cautioned that this is not a cause-and-effect relationship but an association between air pollution and psychosis. What is K2? Although road traffic is responsible for most of the air pollution studied, Fisher said, \"it could really be noise pollution that explains what is happening here.\" Noise disrupts sleep and causes stress, and both are associated with psychotic experiences, she explained. However, if air pollution is causing psychosis, Fisher speculates that the gases and particles might be causing brain inflammation, which previous research suggests may be linked to psychosis. Pollutants could also be \"stunting brain development\" during sensitive periods, which might be linked to psychosis, Fisher said: \"Seventy-five percent of all mental health problems are going to start during this adolescent period, so it's a really good period to go in and prevent some of those longer-term issues.\" What to make of the findings Dr. Jim van Os, a professor and head of the Brain Division at University Medical Center Utrecht, wrote in an email that the paper is \"nice\" but lacks rigor. Exposure to infection in the womb increases risk of autism and depression, study says The finding is \"highly press sensitive\" and \"drawn from a study with literally thousands of variables,\" noted van Os, who has researched and explored psychosis but was not involved in the new research. At best, it is \"a hypothesis to examine in future work. In the absence of replication it does not mean much and is most likely a false positive finding.\" Sophie Dix , a cognitive researcher and director of research at MQ, a nonprofit that funds mental health research, told the Science Media Centre that \"there is more work that needs to be done with this study.\" Slashing fossil fuel use could save millions of lives at risk due to air pollution, study says \"There is no evidence that pollution necessarily causes psychosis or whether this is one of many factors or acting in isolation,\" said Dix, who was not involved in the research. \"There is a bigger picture here, but that does not diminish the importance of these findings and the potential that comes from this.\" Stefan Reis, who heads the Atmospheric Chemistry and Effects Unit at the NERC Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, a research organization, told Science Media Centre that \"the study makes a valuable contribution to the growing body of evidence that air pollution may affect more than just cardio-vascular and respiratory health.\" Reis, who did not participate in the study, said other variables worth exploring could include \"academic attainment in early life stages and cognitive decline in old age due to early-life exposure to air pollution.\" It's important, he concluded, to further our understanding of \"how air pollution is related to mental health outcomes which could in future have implications for air quality policies.\" ERs 'flooded' with mentally ill patients with no place else to turn Marianthi-Anna Kioumourtzoglou , an assistant professor in the Department of Environmental Health Sciences at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, wrote in an editorial published beside the study that \"air pollution exposures are ubiquitous in urban environments,\" yet they are \"modifiable and can be reduced through rigorous regulatory action.\"\n\"It is especially important to identify other factors that may potentially ameliorate the consequences of air pollution to protect human health,\" said Kioumourtzoglou, who had no role in the new research. \"These could be lifestyle, nutritional, or neighborhood-level factors.\" \"As the global population is becoming increasingly urban, it is of utmost importance to incorporate public environmental health into urban planning decisions.\" In the words of the study's authors: \"Given that 70% of the world's population will be urban by 2050, uncovering the mechanisms linking the urban environment to psychosis and developing preventive interventions constitute an urgent health priority.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/helen.2.fisher.html", "https://www.umcutrecht.nl/nl/Over-Ons/Nieuws/2017/Jim-van-Os-nieuwe-medisch-manager-divisie-Hersenen", "https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/joanne.b.newbury.html", "https://www.mqmentalhealth.org/articles/employees", "https://mailchi.mp/cnn/resultsarein", "https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/mk3961", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Van+Os+J%5Bau%5D+psychosis", "https://www.ceh.ac.uk/staff/stefan-reis", "https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/particulate-matter-pm-basics"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joanne newbury", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jama psychiatry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "king's college london", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "newbury", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorado", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-03-27T19:27:45.049+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4e66a11b4a3744e512afdae084579726c4794a3c", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/27/tech/facebook-white-nationalism-ban/index.html", "site_full": "www.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Facebook bans white nationalism two weeks after New Zealand attack -

That number was broken again on Tuesday. McAleenan said the agency is on pace to apprehend and encounter \"over 100,000\" migrants this month. Ninety percent of those are expected to be for illegal border crossings. \"March will be the highest month since 2008,\" he said. Read More In March 2019 alone, almost 40,000 children will come into CBP's custody, McAleenan said, adding that the \"potential for a tragic incident\" during a border crossing or in overwhelmed agency facilities is \"clear and present.\" He said the danger increases as the weather gets hotter. In December, two Guatemalan children died after they were detained with their fathers after crossing the border. 'I don't want to return to Mexico, your honor': Asylum seekers make their plea to immigration judges For months, administration officials have been warning that the changing demographics -- more families, children and a majority of Central Americans arriving -- were causing strain on resources, but the overall numbers of people arriving at the border are now set to reach levels not seen in a decade. The last time the monthly number of border arrests was above 90,000 was in the spring of 2008. During the unaccompanied minor crisis of 2014, the highest monthly total number reached 61,357. \"This stark and increasing shift to more vulnerable populations, combined with the overwhelming numbers, and inadequate capacity to detain families and children at ICE and Health and Human Services, respectively, is creating a humanitarian crisis,\" said McAleenan. CBP is taking over 60 migrants to the hospital each day and is encountering people with severe medical conditions, according to the commissioner. For instance, in the past four days, CBP has seen infants with fevers of 105 degrees and a 2-year-old suffering from seizures in the desert.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kevin mcaleenan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mcaleenan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "customs", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cbp", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "el paso", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-03-27T19:43:11.062+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b37b5f2caedc386f3b225730ed422c6dd44cbb5b", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/27/politics/donald-trump-russian-planes-venezuela/index.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rss%2Fcnn_topstories+%28RSS%3A+CNN+-+Top+Stories%29", "site_full": "edition.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel - HP Hero", "title": "Donald Trump says 'Russia has to get out' of Venezuela - CNNPolitics", "title_full": "Donald Trump says 'Russia has to get out' of Venezuela - CNNPolitics", "published": "2019-03-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190228193608-trump-hidden-grades-cohen-moos-pkg-ebof-vpx-00001823-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 3, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 368, "comments": 266, "shares": 383}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 1}}}, "uuid": "23123ec76f549370272fb4d638f2e88e1034aa8d", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/27/politics/donald-trump-russian-planes-venezuela/index.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Maegan Vazquez", "published": "2019-03-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Donald Trump says 'Russia has to get out' of Venezuela - CNNPolitics", "text": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump on Wednesday called on Russia to \"get out\" of Venezuela following recent reports of Russian planes arriving in the country.\nDuring an Oval Office meeting with Fabiana Rosales, the wife of Juan Guaido, the president of the country's National Assembly, who the Trump administration recognizes as Venezuela's acting president, Trump was asked whether Russia's involvement complicates the situation in Venezuela. \"Russia has to get out.

MUST WATCH\nTrump sticks up for Russia at G7 02:34 Trump's stance against Russia's involvement in Venezuela comes against the backdrop of his repeated defense of Russia in other settings -- including believing Russian President Vladimir Putin's claims that his government did not interfere with the 2016 US election and sticking up for Russia among world leaders at the last G7 summit . Earlier Wednesday, Vice President Mike Pence also addressed Saturday's arrival of the Russian planes. \"The United States views Russia's arrival of military planes this weekend as an unwelcome provocation and we call on Russia today to cease all support for the (Nicolas) Maduro regime, and stand with Guaido, stand with nations across this hemisphere and around the world until freedom is restored,\" Pence said. While the Trump administration made a bold declaration by recognizing Guaido as the acting leader of Venezuela, Russia has continued to back embattled Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro. In December, signs pointed to Russia and Venezuela deepening ties as the Kremlin extended a lifeline to the cash-stripped country by agreeing to restructure $3.15 billion of debt payments that it owes Moscow. Venezuela also owes debts to China, oil service providers, airlines and a slew of other entities. Russian planes arrived at Simon Bolivar International Airport near Caracas on Saturday, a diplomatic source in Caracas told Russian state-owned media RIA Novosti. According to the source, the military came to consult with representatives of Venezuela on military-technical cooperation. The source noted that \"there is nothing mysterious\" because the arrival of the planes is directly related to the implementation of contracts that were signed by the parties many years ago, RIA Novosti reported. But the Trump administration sees things differently. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Monday and called on Russia \"to cease its unconstructive behavior\" in Venezuela, State Department spokesman Robert Palladino said in a statement. The United States \"will not stand idly by as Russia exacerbates tensions in Venezuela,\" the statement said. \"The continued insertion of Russian military personnel to support the illegitimate regime of Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela risks prolonging the suffering of the Venezuelan people who overwhelmingly support interim President Juan Guaido,\" the statement said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/", "https://fave.api.cnn.io/v1/fav/?video=politics/2018/06/08/trump-defends-russia-g7-sanchez.cnn&customer=cnn&edition=international&env=prod"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "juan guaido", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john bolton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fabiana rosales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "united nations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national assembly", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "venezuela", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-03-27T19:43:21.017+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "42dc1288bd802c188f5689345ba553f4382da577", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/27/tech/europe-speed-limits-scli/index.html", "site_full": "www.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Speed limiters: Europe will require carmakers to use the technology from 2022 - CNN", "title_full": "Speed limiters: Europe will require carmakers to use the technology from 2022 - CNN", "published": "2019-03-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190327102437-eu-speed-limit-file-restricted-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 4389, "comments": 2887, "shares": 2011}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 4}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "42dc1288bd802c188f5689345ba553f4382da577", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/27/tech/europe-speed-limits-scli/index.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Charles Riley", "published": "2019-03-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Speed limiters: Europe will require carmakers to use the technology from 2022 - CNN", "text": "London (CNN Busines) New cars sold in Europe from 2022 will have to be fitted with systems to limit their speed.\nUnder new safety rules agreed by the European Union, all new vehicles are required to have \"intelligent speed assistance\" systems as standard equipment. The EU rules don't mandate specific technology for the systems, which can be temporarily overridden by the driver. Some carmakers have already developed ways of using GPS or cameras to detect posted speed limits and make sure vehicles adhere to them. European Commissioner El\u017cbieta Bie\u0144kowska said in a statement that 25,000 people are killed each year on European roads, with the vast majority of accidents being caused by human error. Volvo limits its cars' top speed to 112 miles per hour for safety \"With the new advanced safety features that will become mandatory, we can have the same kind of impact as when the safety belts were first introduced,\" she said. Read More The rules, which also mandate crash data recorders and reversing cameras, were hailed by safety advocates. But others raised concerns over the risk of drivers becoming complacent and less focused on the road conditions. The European Automotive Manufacturers Association also has concerns about the technology. It warned last year of \"many infrastructure-related issues holding back its widespread application.\" It said that road signs are not standardized across Europe, making speed limits difficult to detect. Digital maps lack speed limit information for many roads, and the data is not always current. \"That is why intelligent speed assistance systems should be introduced gradually in cars to provide enough time to update our infrastructure,\" it said in December. Intelligent speed assistance systems don't automatically apply the brakes when a car is going too fast. Instead, they limit engine power to keep vehicles to the speed limit unless overridden by the driver. Volkswagen is betting its future on electric cars Some European automakers see an advantage in limiting speeds. Volvo, which is owned by China's Geely, said earlier this month that it would its stop cars from going faster than 180 kilometers per hour (112 miles per hour). It said it is also considering other technology that could put stricter speed limits on cars driving near schools and hospitals. \"We want to start a conversation about whether car makers have the right or maybe even an obligation to install technology in cars that changes their driver's behavior,\" Volvo CEO H\u00e5kan Samuelsson said at the time. The EU rules must now be formally approved by member states and the European Parliament.
